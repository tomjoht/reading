“The General Theory of Walkability explains how, to be favored, a walk has to satisfy four main conditions: it must be useful, safe, comfortable, and interesting. Each of these qualities is essential and none alone is sufficient. *Useful* means that most aspects of daily life are located close at hand and organized in a way that walking serves them well. *Safe* means that the street has been designed to give pedestrians a fighting chance against being hit by automobiles; they must not only be safe but *feel* safe, which is even tougher to satisfy. *Comfortable* means that buildings and landscapes shape urban streets into "outdoor living rooms," in contrast to wide-open spaces, which usually fail to attract pedestrians. *Interesting* means that sidewalks are lined with unique buildings with friendly faces and that signs of humanity abound.” (prologue)

"[[Walkability]] is both an end and a means, as well as a measure. While the physical and social rewards of walking are many, walkability is perhaps most useful as it contributes to urban vitality and most meaningful as an indicator of that vitality. After several decades spent redesigning pieces of cities, trying to make them more livable and more successful, I have watched my focus narrow to this topic as the one issue that seems to both influence and embody most of the others. Get walkability right and so much of the rest will follow."

"In the absence of any larger vision or mandate, city engineers -- worshiping the twin gods of Smooth Traffic and Ample Parking -- have turned our downtowns into places that are easy to get to but nor worth arriving at."(prologue)

“Long gone are the days when automobiles expanded possibility and choice for the majority of Americans. Now, thanks to its ever-increasing demands for space, speed, and time, the [[car]] has reshaped our landscape and lifestyles around its own needs. It is an instrument of freedom that has enslaved us.”

“Finally, in their quest to become more sustainable, cities need to remember that, for the typical pedestrian, the most mundane storefront is still more interesting than the most luxuriant landscape.”
