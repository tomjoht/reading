_Autonomy: The Quest to Build the Driverless Car―And How It Will Reshape Our World_, by Lawrence Burns

The following is a summary of the Burns' book, with quotes and other commentary.

## Who is the Lawrence Burns?

Lawrence Burns spent three decades at GM as "VP of research, development, and planning" during important transformational times (7). He championed alternative propulsion technologies, so much that a New York Times article referred to him as "the company's champion of electric and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles" (153). Later, he acted as a consultant for Google's autonomous vehicle projects in 2010. Besides his involvement with the auto industry, on a personal level, Burns became a believer in the power of technology to change lives after a cochlear implant returned his hearing. He wrote this book, _Autonomy: The Quest to Build the Driverless Car―And How It Will Reshape Our World_, with a co-author.

## What’s the Burns' main argument?

Burns argues that the transportation industry is on the verge of disruption from "three separate but related factors -- shared-use vehicles, powered by electric motors, and driven autonomously" (8). Burns believes that "thanks for these converging forces, we're at an inflection point, a once-in-a-century opportunity to redefine not just the auto industry, but personal mobility itself" (102).

These converging factors will lead to abandonment of private car ownership in favor of self-driving robotaxis that anyone can summon at a moment's notice and be transported to their destination for much less than it would cost to own a car. Automakers will probably evolve into AV fleet operators, and these vehicles, all electric, will remove our dependence on oil.

Detroit missed out on key opportunities to lead out in this space at the right time. Instead of pouring more resources into EV and AV development, Burns says automakers struggled to stay afloat financially (the innovator's dilemma). Fortunately, Google had deep pockets and had the vision to fund development efforts to move forward in this space. Because autonomous EVs are heavily software oriented, tech companies will control the future of the automotive industry, relegating automakers to more of a packager or fleet operator. Mobility will transition into an affordable service available to everyone.

## How did efforts for self-driving technology begin?

The first 80 pages of the book starts out by relating the origins of autonomous driving development with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) contests. Robotics engineers developed self-driving cars to successfully navigate through complex offroad terrain. The military felt that autonomous technology could save soldiers’ lives by removing them from explosive devices, mines, etc. Burns gives so much attention to the DARPA development time period that it (frustratingly) delays the introduction of the larger themes about transportation. But in retrospect, the focus on DARPA establishes an important point: autonomy began as a military initiative, out of a specific need: to remove human drivers from dangerous vehicle situations.

AV efforts later evolved into an application that could potentially transform transportation in general (not just for military vehicles). For these reasons, Sergey Brin and Larry Page supported these early efforts at AV development during DARPA. The Google founders had a vision about AVs solving major problems related to transportation. Page had gone to the University of Michigan (1991-95) and had impressionable experiences waiting for buses (which sometimes never arrived) in a cold weather. He felt the transportation model could be improved through autonomous mobility pods that could be available at a moment's notice. Page's father worked at a GM plant, and Page himself was deeply interested in autonomous car development. Burns explains: 

> "Page became obsessed with alternative solutions. Those interminable minutes that Page spent waiting for the bus in the Michigan winter convinced him to draft, as a U of M student, an idea for a personal rapid-transportation system, an interconnected monorail on which two-person mobility pods were available on a moment's notice to ferry riders where they wished." (5) 

Page even joined a solar-car racing team and almost studied autonomous car development instead of search engines (4-6). 

Observing the autonomous vehicles in the DARPA challenges, the Google founders saw a huge opportunity for a disruptive transformation with the auto industry. Even if it was just a 10% chance of success, they felt like they had to take it. Even though the robotics engineers were skeptical that autonomous cars could replace manually driving cars, Brin and Page persuaded the engineers that if there wasn’t a technical reason preventing autonomous models from working, then they should do it. 

Burns summarizes those initial meetings with the robotics engineers, particularly Sebastian Thrun: 

> "Look, Sebastian," Thrun recalls Page telling him, "you should work on self-driving cars. "Why?" Thrun asked. "Well," Page said, "if this business succeeds, it could be bigger than Google. Which means, even if there's just a ten percent chance of this succeeding, it's worth the investment" (165-66). 

Even with this encouragement, there was a lot of reluctance to continue AV development. Burns explains:

> Thrumsen [the lead engineer] told Page, "It's too hard. It can't be done." But Larry Page came back the next day. "I've thought about this. Give me a technical reason why it can't be done. Not a societal reason. A *technical* reason." Page was looking for something definitive. Something like, today's computers aren't yet powerful enough to process that data required to safely navigate a highway at legal speed.... [Thrun again said it couldn't be done.] And still Page wouldn't take no for an answer. ... So Thrun went home and tried to think of a technical reason. And he couldn't. 'Shit,' he said to Page the next day. 'I can't really think of a technical reason.... The thought is certain to have occurred to Thrun--what sort of technical feats might be possible with the sort of budget Google's backing could provide?' (166-67)

The Google founders believed technology could be used to solve the world's biggest problems (190), and automobiles and transportation were a problem just waiting to be tackled. With endless monetary resources to pursue the solution, the engineers decided to try the impossible.

## Burns' vision of transportation disruption

Throughout the book, Burns is enthusiastic about disrupting transportation and mobility. In Burns' vision, in the future of transportation, most people don't own cars themselves. Instead, companies operate fleets of robotaxi vehicles that people can summon at a moment's notice. It's significantly cheaper, specifically, about $5,625 less (225), to use the robotaxis than to own your own car. The author quotes Travis Kalanic of Uber: "... the magic there is that you basically bring the cost down below the cost of ownership. For *everybody*. And then car ownership goes away" (266). Just as Ford's true innovation was the assembly line, which brought down the cost of vehicles and made them affordable, when robotaxis become significantly less than private car ownership, adoption will take off.

What about congestion? Because cars become shared-use vehicles, Burns says they'll make up only 15% of the total of cars today. Currently, most people leave their cars parked 90% of the time. These robotaxis will be in constant service. Burns says, "In every case, a shared fleet size equal to about 15 percent of the number of cars owned in these cities would provide responsive and efficient mobility service" (223). Burns provides a number of calculations in the book, though it's hard to assess them.

The autonomous vehicles are powered with alternative propulsion systems, meaning the AVs are mostly electric vehicles, which removes our dependence on oil (301). 

Another benefit is that safety will increase. Crashes will practically non-existent since AVs are much safer as well (302).

Overall, Burns says, "The new age of automobility promises to profoundly improve the way regular people live their daily lives. It democratizes the benefits of convenient, whenever-you-want, wherever-you-want transportation to people who couldn't previously afford it: the very young and the very old ..." (227). This future transportation model will "re-envision the way Americans move around and interact" (120).

Burns called GM's EV concept car "Autonomy," similar to the title of his book, because it encapsulates the larger goal of autonomous-driving car: "... freedom is what automobiles are all about" (122). The author sees the automobile industry as providing freedom and autonomy to individuals in regards to their mobility -- going places, on their own terms and will. Burns says, "Today, one hundred years after the automobile's invention... only twelve percent of the people in the world enjoy the freedom benefits of personal transportation ... Autonomy offers the promise of extending this freedom to even more people" (124). For the 88% of the world that doesn't own a car, the new transportation as a service model will unlock mobility for them.

Note that cars aren't what's being transformed here, but rather mobility itself. Burns says, "Before, mobility was a commodity in the form of individual cars that the companies sold. In the future, mobility was a *service* the companies would operate over time" (272). As such, in this vision of the future, automakers transition into fleet operators, and tech companies license the mobility services to them.

One question is whether Burns vision of the future of transportation matches Google's vision.Brin seems to agree, at least in part. After providing a reporter with a test drive of Firefly (a Waymo prototype), Brin says, "'Regardless of Google ... I think the right model for most of the world will be not through vehicle ownership ... These should be provided as services for the most part'" (261). 

In fact, during early AV development ("Project Chauffeur") at Google, Google was trying to test an Highway Assistant feature. Employees dogfooded the feature, but unfortunately it "lulled its operators into a relaxed state..." (238). Soon the Chauffeur team scrapped Highway Assistant "so that they could concentrate on solving the entire problem: creating a self-driving car that could handle every aspect of an automobile's operation..." (239). In other words, rather than chasing Autopilot-like features, Google chose to focus on its original goal: fully autonomous driving. The fact that Waymo ("way for mobility") is a robotaxi service suggests that Google's vision aligns with Burns'.

## Detroit versus Silicon Valley culture

Throughout the book, Burns expresses some remorse about opportunities missed. After all, as VP of research and development at GM, and champion of alternative propulsion, why couldn't Detroit get it right? At one point, Google tried to partner with Detroit, but Detroit wasn't interested (197). Why did Detroit more or less miss out on being a leader in this space?

Burns says, "GM had every opportunity to do what Google did in 2009--and it had even more of an opportunity to do what Uber did in 2015, which is to say, hire some of the best robotics minds in the world and point them at the rapid development of self-driving cars. GM, after all, had a long-standing relationship with Carnegie Mellon. Which raises the question: Why *didn't* they? In fact, why did it take Detroit as a whole, so long to realize the importance of this stuff?" 283

First, Detroit and Silicon Valley cultures clashed in strong ways. People in Detroit were confused about the purpose of a self-driving car. Their response was usually like, "What's the point of what? People *like* to drive" (191). Detroit wasn’t originally on board with AVs. They felt that people *liked* driving. Self-driving vehicles would take this pleasure away. Detroit was full of auto people loved the feel of a car’s acceleration, handling around curves, the roar of the engine. They were very much an auto-loving culture of people who love driving, love the purr of the engines. They didn't understand Silicon Valley’s desire to take this away. 

Burns says, "It was extraordinary threatening to people who have grown up in the auto industry to contemplate taking the driver out of the equation.... If I talked to Detroit CEOs and told them I was working on a self-driving car, they would give me a smile and walk away" (199).

It took a while to come around to the idea, but Detroit eventually realized that while people might love driving on open roads, no one loved their commute. The commute was draining and wasted time. And having so many cars enter the city only to remain parked/unused all day was highly inefficient.

Besides being wary about the effort, the auto industry suffered a major financial crisis in 2008. They weren't financially able to keep pouring money into research and experimentation for something that might not even work out. Automakers were just trying to stay afloat and needed sell cars to remain solvent. But in trying to remain afloat financially, Detroit lost out on a golden opportunity to get a jump on EV development at the right time. Detroit didn’t seize the moment before the auto trends shifted directions. Burns says their mistake with EV development was to not realize that "profitability wouldn't come until several vehicle generations down the road" (119).

Burns says it's the classic innovator's dilemma. How do you stay competitive in the future if you're not pouring money into R&D and trying new innovations that could lead to disruptions, as other companies not yet in the spotlight are doing? And yet, redirecting money into R&D efforts puts the prevailing product and its sustaining development at risk. It's hard to pursue EV development if EVs aren't profitable. It wasn't until Tesla that EVs became a highly desirable vehicle (146).

At one point, Burns was asked if GM could fund a joint venture to further AV DARPA research. Burns says, 

> ...at that point, in 2008, GM was devoting all its energy to surviving historically low consumer automobile demand. Nearly all of my fellow GM executives considered autonomous cars to be a half century away; at least-- if they even considered the possibility at all. With the specter of bankruptcy looming, there was no way I could gather the budget required to pursue the opportunity, a fact that I regret to this day. And the other major automakers were too busy fighting bankruptcy as well. (160)

Burns says this transportation revolution was mostly a missed opportunity from automakers. But "... one company did listen. Not coincidentally, this was the same company that was further ahead than anyone else in developing autonomous vehicles for consumers. That company was Google. And the reason they were listening was because Larry Page and Sergey Brin deeply believed that this thing was possible" (232-33). Google is so highly lauded in Burns' book because it's the one company that understood the direction things were heading early and invested heavily in this area. Google's investment reinforces Burns' vision.

In contrast to GM, it was easier for Google to disrupt itself, since it didn't have any auto products to sustain. Chris Urmson, one of the AV engineers, says, "It's really hard for big companies to disrupt themselves.... One of Google's gifts was that they didn't have a product in this space.... They didn't have to worry about how it fit into an existing portfolio. They could just focus on the next thing" (283-84). 

## Google's involvement and the transformation of an industry

As Google started testing out autonomous prototypes, many people wondered what Google, an ads/search company, was doing in the automotive space (169). To allay concerns, Burns says Google published an article explaining some of the motives: 

> Larry and Sergey founded Google because they wanted to help solve really big problems using technology... And one of the big problems we're working on today is care safety and efficiency. Our goal is to help prevent traffic accidents, free up people's time and reduce carbon emissions by fundamentally changing car use.... While this project is very much in the experimental stage, it provides a glimpse of what transportation might look like in the future thanks to advanced computer science. And that future is very exciting." 190 quote from article about testing AV cars in public. https://www.channel4.com/news/google-tests-car-that-drives-itself

Google’s initial project for developing autonomous cars was called Chauffeur, started around 2008. As the AV concept gathered more steam, some in Detroit feared that Google would massively disrupt the automotive industry. To study these developments, Detroit would periodically buy competitive EV cars and strip them down to every nut and bolt to analyze them. One day Burns had a major realization. Electric cars had a tenth the number of parts as combustion engines. 

Burns says, "With just one-tenth the parts, the electric vehicle was a lot easier to make. Not only did an electric vehicle have fewer parts, it also had far fewer *moving* parts than a conventional automobile. ... Electric vehicles would require far fewer employees to assemble the vehicle. Like, one-tenth the number of employees" (131). 

Besides fewer parts, Burns also realized that the heart of the AV car was the software, not the hardware. This represented a key shift away from Detroit's expertise in engine development to Silicon Valley's expertise with software development. Burns says, "The crucial expertise in electric vehicles was software.... These projects would be engineered not by experts in the vagaries of the internal-combustion engine, but by programmers expert in the same ones and zeroes that ran your computer...." (132). Just as internal combustion engines were shifted to battery-powered engines, auto mechanics would shift to computer programmers.

This shift meant that automakers were "becoming little more than a packager. A tuner. A sales channel, which took other companies' valuable expertise and basically repackaged it into the vehicles bought by consumers" (132-33)

Automakers realized that it's not the hardware makers that hold the power, but the software makers. "...it turned out that the real differentiator when it came to a computer was the software that was on the device -- and the power migrated to the OS makers, the Microsofts and Apples, until the hardware makers were little more than afterthoughts" (284-85).

With fewer parts, and the car being mostly a computer sitting on a skateboard, Burns and others wondered what the role of Detroit would be with AVs. Would Detroit be a packager? What value would they add? With combustion engines, there were a lot of parts and a high degree of complexity to get them working in harmony, to create a vehicle that could withstand years of driving, rough weather, and other abuse. It wasn't an easy feat to pull off. Now, all that expertise would become irrelevant in a new era of software-driven cars.

## The need for map data

* Street View tremendous innovation for map data to aid AV driving technology
* interpreting objects that aren't there in previous scans
* high-definition map data not feasible by any company that isn't Google

AVs didn't just need software driving technology, they also needed map data. Google's Street View technology allowed them to capture detailed street view imagery and marry that information to digital maps. These highly detailed maps then powered navigation for autonomous vehicles. 

Burns says, "...Street View and its successor program, Ground Truth, represented an important step in the development of autonomous-driving technology --because Chauffeur's approach to the safe and reliable deployment of self-driving cars required highly accurate maps of the roads its vehicles navigated.... Having map data let you do some *amazing* stuff..." (172-73).

Burns explains the significance of Street View (including the history of scandals surrounding Anthony Levandowski). Street View unlocked a treasure of detail that then informed Google Maps.Burns explains:

> Google's development of the Street View service stands as a cartographic achievement unmatched since the days of Vasco da Gama and Magellan. ... The Street View project made possible Ground Truth, and excellent and accurate location-based search, because Google could use artificial intelligence and computer-vision software to pull from the Street View data the real-world location of every retailer, restaurant and address in any area it service. ... It also could be used to provide people with navigation directions" (172).

Although autonomous cars have many sensors and even Lidar to detect objects around them, maps can help software interpret objects. If an object doesn't exist in a digital map, it's likely that the object could be a pedestrian, cyclist, or other moving vehicle. Burns explains: "The car would also compare its preexisting list of stationary objects with the objects around it to discover which ones were likely to move -- helping the car differentiate between a mailbox and a pedestrian, or a light pole and a cyclist" (173). In short, map data helps confirm what the sensors are seeing (175).

To get to full autonomous driving, you need both maps and software. Burns says,

> ...getting to full autonomy, the kind that allows you to think it's a good idea to make a car without a steering wheel or brakes, requires really good maps--a high-resolution 3-D scan of every road the self-driving car is going to ride, ever. Which, in the early days, would have seemed insurmountable to nearly any company or researcher that *wasn't* Google." (285)

The effort required to canvas the world's roads and cities and create highly detailed digital maps that could provide the data that autonomous vehicles needed to operate intelligently seemed like a task that only a large tech company, with mapping and software expertise, could pull off. Burns says, "... it's hard to imagine a future that sees the major automakers with their market capitalizations in the tens of billions of dollars ever outright beating the technology companies, like Alphabet, Apple and Amazon, with values that bob in the middle hundred billions" (324).

Another aspect of AV development involves testing. Here Burns also praises Google, contrasting it with Tesla. Tesla hasn't been nearly as safety conscious as Google, as they pushed out vehicles with lofty promises, not fully testing the features (for example, they couldn't recognize vehicles traveling sideways on freeways, like a crossing tractor), and these crashes/deaths brought scrutiny with safety agencies. It set back AVs from more adoption and support quite a few years. In contrast, Google has been testing self-driving vehicles for 7+ years with only a tiny little fender bender accident. 

Burns says, "As an enthusiastic proponent of self-driving technology, I feel lucky that Larry Page and Sergey Brin funded the development of the technology long before Elon Musk ever automated the driving of his vehicles. Google conducted its self-driving tests on public roads for seven years without its systems being implicated in a single crash--and when it finally did come along, it was a fender bender that occurred at 2 mph" (315).

## Conclusion

Burns has rose-colored glasses on when it comes to the transformations within the transportation industry, and he tells the story from a pro-Google point of view (no doubt his employment as a consultant inclines a certain bias), but his book provides an important account in this genre. There's probably no better history of Waymo and Google's involvement with AVs than Burns' book. In a [book review of *Autonomy* by Mark Harris](https://spectrum.ieee.org/auto-consultant-lawrence-burns-dishes-the-dirt-on-waymo#toggle-gdpr), Harris says Burns was hired because they "needed someone to bridge the gap between Silicon Valley and Detroit. ... They were looking for an executive that had a vision for the technology but also knew how the OEMs [car makers] and regulators work." Burns definitely provides this bridging function through his book, telling the story to include both Detroit and Silicon Valley's perspectives.
