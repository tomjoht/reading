- Page studies at Univ of Michigan, grandfather works in GM plan. introduced to transportation issues from 1991-1995 in Ann Arbor. "Page became obsessed with alternative solutions. Those interminable minutes that Page spent waiting for the bus in the Michigan winter convinced him to draft, as a U of M student, an idea for a personal rapid-transportation system, an interconnected monorail on which two-person mobility pods were available on a moment's notice to ferry riders where they wished." 5 Page joined a solar-car racing team. Page almost studied autonomous car development instead of search engines. 4-6

Author is "VP of research, developingment, and planning. "I felt like it was my *responsibility* to accelerate the development of alternatives to the current transportation system." 6 major issues he wants to tackle: "oil dependence, safety issues, traffic congestion, and global warming -- these and other ills were solvable ... if only we'd transform the auto industry." 7

see the transportation industry entering period of disruption due to convergence of "three separate but related factors -- shared-use vehicles, powered by electric motors, and driven autonomously." 8 "Driverless technology," the "electrification of motor vehicles" (removing oil dependence), and "transportation as a service (Uber, Lyft, etc)" 102. "thanks for these converging forces, we're at an inflection point, a once-in-a-century opportunity to redefine not just the auto industry, but personal mobility itself." 102

vision: use an app to summon a driverless car to take you to any destination. 102

see the disruption as a huge financial shift in having automakers sell cars to people for private ownership to automakers controlling fleets of cars and not having private ownership. "self-driving taxis." 9 

Page and Brin are super supportive of AV development efforts and DARPA trials.

Making the car affordable was Ford's great innovation that launched the car's popularity. EVs face the same challenge. 104. 

car industry depends on road building and infrastructure for vitality. 106

The innovation of the car was that "It offered freedom on the cheap: You could go where you want to, when you want to, all at a reasonable cost.... Today, similarly nascent innovations -- autonomous technology, alternative-propulsion methods and the ride-sharing business model of transportation--will have a similarly transformative effect on the way people get around." 107



The author spent 3 decades in GM Research Laboratories. GM has most GAS implementations.

cars = freedom

The author's cochlear implant that returns his hearing makes him a believer in technology's ability to transform lives.

says mistake with EV development was to not realize that "profitability wouldn't come until several vehicle generations down the road" 119

Future of cars vision: the author is excited to "re-envision the way Americans move around and interact" 120.

The author calls their EV concept car "Autonomy" "because freedom is what automobiles are all about." 122. The author sees the automobile industry as providing freedom and autonomy to individuals about their mobility -- going places, on their own terms and wills. That's kind of cool. "Today, one hundred years after the automobile's invention... only twelve percent of the people in the world enjoy the freedom benefits of personal transportation ... Autonomy offers the promise of extending this freedom to even more people." 124

"With just one-tenth the parts, the electric vehicle was a lot easier to make. Not only did an electric vehicle have fewer parts, it also had far fewer *moving* parts than a conventional automobile. ... Electric vehicles would require far fewer employees to assemble the vehicle. Like, one-tenth the number of employees' ' 131. (seems to run counter to Musk's challenge of manufacturing EVs.)

"The crucial expertise in electric vehicles was software.... These projects would be engineered not by experts in the vagaries of the internal-combustion engine, but by programmers expert in the same ones and zeroes that ran your computer...." 132 From ICE to batter, then shift from mechanics to programmers. 

"A GM that continued with business as usual risked becoming little more than a packager. A tuner. A sales channel, which took other companies' valuable expertise and basically repackaged it into the vehicles bought by consumers." 132-33

the vision: "Soon, personal mobility will be dominated by transportation-as-a-service models, akin to self-driving versions of today's Uber or Lyft ride-sharing services. Fleet operators will own their vehicles throughout a 300,000-mile use cycle." 135

quote from someone: "Cars are great for going long distances... BUt it makes no sense at all for people in cities to use a 4,000-lb. piece of metal to haul their 150-lb. asses around town." 140 author talking about Segway. different vehicles excel in different environments. 140. SUVs are great for cross-country trip, while Segway good for going through dense urban areas and short distances.

gas prices changed consumer preferences. 145 
to stay alive, you have to make $ and sell cars. you can't pursue EVs if they are not profitable. It's the innovator's dilemma. 146 this is a constant conundrum.

The author receives a lot of backlash about PUMA, a concept for a Personal Urban Mobility and Accessibility vehicle (top speed 35mph, seats 2). lots of backlash toward GM due to gas-guzzling SUVs that it creates. "What I hadn't expected was how hostile some of the people would be to anything that General Motors did." 150

in nytimes article about his departure, burns is described as "the company's champion of electric and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles." 153


Bill Mitchell, Reinventing the Automobile: Personal Urban Mobility for the 21st Century. "Mitchell regarded contemporary cities as broken--and the thing that had broken them was the automobile.... *Reinventing the Automobile** stated my feelings on the automobile's situation a lot more bluntly than I might have put it had I stayed at GM. Teh book described how much trouble cars caused the world, and argued that a new iteration of autombile represented a powerful part of the solution to these problems. ...[The old automobile was ICE-powered, the new would be electric and autonomous.]" 154

was asked if GM could fund a joint venture to further AV driving DARPA research. "...at that point, in 2008, GM was devoting all its energy to surviving historically low consumer automobile demand. Nearly all of my fellow GM executives considered autonomous cars to be a half century away; at least-- if they even considered the possibility at all. With the specter of bankruptcy looming, there was no way I could gather the budget required to pursue the opportunity, a fact that I regret to this day. And the other major automakers were too busy fighting bankruptcy as well." 160

Here comes Google and its deep pockets to save the day. 

seems like GPS came out around 2008? smartphones and GPS revolutionized things. Google's Ground Truth project: StreetView imagery? Street View imagery can aid with ground truth ("the truth of what you see on the ground")
 161

Levandowski -- has tech to marry Street View to location info. 164

"Look, Sebastian," Thrun recalls Page telling him, "you should work on self-driving cars. "Why?" Thrun asked. "Well," Page said, "if this business succeeds, it could be bigger than Google. Which means, even if there's just a ten percent chance of this succeeding, it's worth the investment." 165-66

Thrumsen told Page, "It's too hard. It can't be done." But Larry Page came back the next day. "I've thought about this. Give me a technical reason why it can't be done. Not a societal reason. A *technical* reason." Page was looking for something definitive. Something like, today's computers aren't yet powerful enough to process that data required to safely navigate a highway at legal speed.... [Thrun says it can't be done.] And still Page wouldn't take no for an answer. ... So Thrun went home and tried to think of a technical reason. And he couldn't. 'Shit,' he said to Page the next day. 'I can't really think of a technical reason.... The thought is certain to have occurred to Thrun--what sort of technical feats might be possible with the sort of budget Google's backing could provide?' 166-67

People wonder what Google's interest is in cars. They are, after all, a search engine company. "Google's project, Urmson argued, could transform the world. Could transform the way billions of regular people around the planet went from place to place." 169

"Google's development of the Street View service stands as a cartographic achievement unmatched since the days of Vasco da Gama and Magellan. ... The Street View project made possible Ground Truth, and excellent and accurate location-based search, because Google could use artificial intelligence and computer-vision software to pull from the Street View data the real-world location of every retailer, restaurant and address in any area it service. ... It also could be used to provide people with navigation directions." 172

Google projects: Street View, Ground Truth, Chauffeur

"...Street View and its successor program, Ground Truth, represented an important step in the development of autonomous-driving technology --because Chauffeur's approach to the safe and reliable deployment of self-driving cars required highly accurate maps of the roads its vehicles navigated.... Having map data let you do some *amazing* stuff..." 172-73

"The car would also compare its preexisting list of stationary objects with the objects around it to discover which ones were likely to move -- helping the car differentiate between a mailbox and a pedestrian, or a light pole and a cyclist. [for new shapes not on previous scans, it could be a pedestrian or cyclist.]" 173

map data helps sensors confirm what they're seeing. 175ish

Some self-driving vehicles can navigate a course faster than a human. military applications. 182

The team gets google's funding at a time when automakers are bankrupt. problem: testing on public streets. 186

"Larry and Sergey founded Google because they wanted to help solve really big problems using technology... And one of the big problems we're working on today is care safety and efficiency. Our goal is to help prevent traffic accidents, free up people's time and reduce carbon emissions by fundamentally changing car use.... While this project is very much in the experimental stage, it provides a glimpse of what transportation might look like in the future thanks to advanced computer science. And that future is very exciting." 190 quote from article about testing AV cars in public. https://www.channel4.com/news/google-tests-car-that-drives-itself

People in Detroit are confused about the purpose of a self-driving car. "What's the point of what? People *like* to drive." 191. 

Google tries to partner with Detroit, but Detroit is not interested. 197

"It was extraordinary threatening to people who have grown up in the auto industry to contemplate taking the driver out of the equation.... If I talked to Detroit CEOs and told them I was working on a self-driving car, they would give me a smile and walk away." 199


Tesla redefined attitudes toward EVs. 209. no longer lightweight, slow, tiny. Tesla pits Silicon Valley against Detroit. "It may have been the first company to pit Silicon Valley against Detroit." 209

He sees ride hailing apps another piece in the disruptive forces that can change our mobility. 210. This is one of "four disruptive forces that had been unleashed on the American transportation system." 215

the four disruptive forces: "DARPA, Carnegie Mellon, Stanford and Google had demonstrated that autonomous vehicles were viable. GM's EN-V concept, a star of the Shanghai World Expo, had highlighted the promise of vehicles tailor-designed for our most frequent trips instead of being over-designed to handle all conceivable trips. Zipcar, Lyft and Uber were divorcing Americans from the idea that you had to down the vehicle you rode in. And Tesla was making electric vehicles mainstream. Individually, each of the trends offered significant improvement over the 130-year-old automobile transportation system. But I was more interested in what could result from combining them. I sensed a new age of automobility was imminent. I believed this new age promised better mobility and safety for more people at lower personal and environment cost, and I wanted to more deeply understand the impacts of the convergence." 215-16

Burns' vision is one of a fleet of robotaxis you can summon at will. 218

"In every case, a shared fleet size equal to about 15 percent of the number of cars owned in these cities would provide responsive and efficient mobility service." 223

"All told, our calculations suggested that employing a shared driverless and electric mobility solution could save a driver $5,625 a year, plus the value of all the time that not driving frees up." 225

"The new age of automobility promises to profoundly improve the way regular people live their daily lives. It democratizes the benefits of convenient, whenever-you-want, wherever-you-want transportation to people who couldn't previously afford it: the very young and the very old ..." 227

He says this transportation revolution was mostly a missed opportunity from automakers. But "... one company did listen. Not coincidentally, this was the same company that was further ahead than anyone else in developing autonomous vehicles for consumers. That company was Google. And the reason they were listening was because Larry Page and Sergey Brin deeply believed that this thing was possible." 232-33

Early testing of Chauffeur with Google employees dogfooding it revealed that it "lulled its operators into a relaxed state..." 238. Chauffeur stops with the highway driver's assist b/c testing it is too hard and it wasn't the original goal of disrupting transportation -- it would just make commuting more convenient. 238  Soon the Chauffeur team scraps Highway Assistant "so that they could concentrate on solving the entire problem: creating a self-driving car that could handle every aspect of an automobile's operation..." 239

After a test drive of Firefly (an early Waymo prototype?) Brin says... "'Regardless of Google,' Brin told Markoff, 'I think the right model for most of the world will be not through vehicle ownership ... These should be provided as services for the most part." 261

AV will make ride hailing services so cheap that it will be much better than owning a car. So AV tech will unlock transportation as a service and make private car ownership antiquated.  Kalanick (Uber founder) says. "... so the magic there is that you basically bring the cost down below the cost of ownership. For *everybody*. And then car ownership goes away." 266

Kalanick (Uber): "There's real advancement for how cities work, and how people *move* in cities, that is going to change our lives." 267

"Before, mobility was a commodity in the form of individual cars that the companies sold. In the future, mobility was a *service* the companies would operate over time." 272 automakers transition to fleet operators.

In 2016, GM bought Cruise Automation, an SV startup that GM plans to use to bring it into the autonomous future. 282

"GM had every opportunity to do what Google did in 2009--and it had even more of an opportunity to do what Uber did in 2015, which is to say, hire some of the best robotics minds in the world and point them at the rapid development of self-driving cars. GM, after all, had a long-standing relationship with Carnegie Mellon. Which raises the question: Why *didn't* they? In fact, why did it take Detroit as a whole, so long to realize the importance of this stuff?" 283

"Then there's the innovator's dilemma. It's really hard for big companies to disrupt themselves...." Chris Urmson: 'One of Google's gifts was that they didn't have a product in this space.... They didn't have to worry about how it fit into an existing portfolio. They could just focus on the next thing." 283, 284. 

Automakers realize that it's not the hardware makers that hold the power, but the software makers. "...it turned out that the real differentiator when it came to a computer was the software that was on the device -- and the power migrated to the OS makers, the Microsofts and Apples, until the hardware makers were little more than afterthoughts." 284-85

"...getting to full autonomy, the kind that allows you to think it's a good idea to make a car without a steering wheel or brakes, requires really good maps--a high-resolution 3-D scan of every road the self-driving car is going to ride, ever. Which, in the early days, would have seemed insurmountable to nearly any company or researcher that *wasn't* Google. ." 285

The author also sees the EV revolution as getting America out of oil dependence. 301 he also sees safety, esp. from growing distraction of smartphones, as key benefits. 302

The author praises Google's responsible testing of the AVs in contrast to Tesla, which is reckless. But testing is a major obstacle to bringing the cars to market. 311-12. 

"As an enthusiastic proponent of self-driving technology, I feel lucky that Larry Page and Sergey Brin funded the development of the technology long before Elon Musk ever automated the driving of his vehicles. Google conducted its self-driving tests on public roads for seven years without its systems being implicated in a single crash--and when it finally did come along, it was a fender bender that occurred at 2 mph." 315

"The enmity that once characterized the relationship between Silicon Valley and Detroit has given way to a spirit of collaboration." 319

Cruise Automation --> GM
Argo AI --> Ford
Mobileye --> Tesla
Waymo --> Alphabet (Google)

Bob Lutz, chairman of GM, publishes an essay in Automotive News. "The era of the human-driven automobile, its repair facilities, its dealerships, the media surrounding it -- all will be gone in 20 years... The end state will be the fully autonomous module with no capability for the driver to exercise command." 324


"... it's hard to imagine a future that sees the major automakers with their market capitalizations in the tens of billions of dollars ever outright beating the technology companies, like Alphabet, Apple and Amazon, with values that bob in the middle hundred billions." 324

## Reading experience: 

Author narrates experiences, but written by co-writer. 
Lots of detail about the original DARPA races that was kind of boring. Occupies first 100 pages. 
Burns’ insider experience is fascinating. Has 3 decades as head of R&D in GM, right through these transformative times. Insider view of everything going on. Also worked as consultant for google.
Writing style is not the best. Always tries to describe the personality of the person before quoting. 
Burns has endless optimism for 


## Questions

What is Google's vision of the future of transportation? After a test drive of Firefly (an early Waymo prototype?) Brin says... "'Regardless of Google,' Brin told Markoff, 'I think the right model for most of the world will be not through vehicle ownership ... These should be provided as services for the most part." 261. see also p. 262-63

Why is Google involved in the automotive industry? Is google trying to solve transportation, offering a way for mobility for all, or does google see a massive business opportunity? or both?  see also p. 262-63

Does Geo Auto pursue Page's vision with autonomous vehicles? it seems we shifted to luxury EVs with autopilot modes, rather than the original vision of transforming what transportation looks like. Why? Tesla?

The author's excitement toward EVs is the vision of a transportation network with cars that aren't privately owned. What happened to that vision? It seems all OEMs are not really embracing the fleet model of AVs, but rather just implementing autopilots to copy Tesla. I can get excited about AV fleets, but not so much about every OEM having its own luxury EV version of a Tesla copy.

The author feels remorse at having missed the opportunity to develop viable EV models during pivotal historical times. But during those times, automakers were squeezed by financial pressure to sell cars just to stay afloat. How do companies sink time into R&D that might not pay off until a generation later while simultaneously staying afloat in the present? This is the innovator's dilemma. "Just at the moment that I could so clearly see that technology stood to solve many of the auto's big problems -- the automobile industry was cratering." 152 Also p. 283: GM had long relationships with Carnegie Mellon (robotics experts involved in AV development). "GM had every opportunity to do what Google did in 2009--and it had even more of an opportunity to do what Uber did in 2015, which is to say, hire some of the best robotics minds in the world and point them at the rapid development of self-driving cars. GM, after all, had a long-standing relationship with Carnegie Mellon. Which raises the question: Why *didn't* they? In fact, why did it take Detroit as a whole, so long to realize the importance of this stuff?" 283


"The enmity that once characterized the relationship between Silicon Valley and Detroit has given way to a spirit of collaboration." 319 How did this happen?

[Question: Did we lose the vision that Google had about transportation? No longer moving towards that vision but instead trying to make money by selling map data to OEMs so they can sell luxury private EVs?]


Is Burns naive with his calculations about how much it will save everyone?

Is the only way to offset the high cost of a robotaxi by aggressively targeting the passengers with advertising?

Why is Google in this space?

Is the author's portrayal of Google too soft? Is the author not critical enough about the potential motives of Google to profit from this transportation disruption?

Was Google primarily responsible for persuading engineers to apply AV development to solve transportation issues unrelated to military purposes?

Is this vision playing out? 
- Lyft/Uber only worsen congestion and transportation issues, and it's not cheap. The companies aren't profitable either.
- AV is now an autopilot mode in a private car costing 100K, and you can maybe enable the mode on a remote Nevada freeway.
- EVs rely on battery mining that can't support the need, and which has its own environmental destruction that some say only nets an environment gain after the EV car has gone 15,000-20,000 miles.
