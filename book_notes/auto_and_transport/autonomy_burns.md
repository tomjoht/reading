[[autonomous cars]]

## What’s the author’s main argument?

Story of self-driving vehicle tech is one in which Detroit was initially resistant, came to see the light too late in the game due to their love of driving. Silicon Valley capitalized on a convergence of several aligning factors – alternative propulsion, AV technology, distributed ride hailing services – all of which aligned to give rise to a major transformation of the auto industry that promises to offer mobility to everyone at a cheaper cost. The book is more about telling the story of change from inside the vantage point of Detroit over several pivotal decades and the challenges of developing self-driving technology. The author tells the story of [[Google]]’s involvement in the AV part of auto from the beginning, including [[Waymo]].

## Who is the author?

The author spent three decades at GM, has tremendous insider knowledge. Also consultant for Google during Chauffeur project. Provides details not likely to find elsewhere.

## How did efforts for self-driving technology begin?

Burns starts by relating the origins of self-driving initiatives, beginning with Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). The initiative from the military was to spur development of self-driving technology for military vehicles. The military felt that autonomous technology could save soldiers’ lives by removing them from explosive devices, mines, etc. 

The AV initiatives evolved into transportation applications as well. Burns describes the insistence from Google founders Sergey Brin and Larry Page that technology could solve big problems related to transportation, not just helping the military drive unmanned vehicles. They persuaded lead robotics engineers working on DARPA challenges that if there wasn’t a technical reason preventing autonomous models from working, then they should do it. 

Google founders also saw a huge opportunity for a disruptive transformation with the auto-industry. Even if it was just a 10% chance of success, they felt like they had to take it. Page and Brin seem invested from the earliest days, even feeling personally connected to a solution from being stuck in Michigan waiting for a bus that never came.

From earliest days, Page and Brin's vision was to reinvent [[mobility]], to disrupt how transportation worked to a fully driverless model with transportation as a service -- not privately owned autonomous vehicles. In fact, when they were faced with challenges in testing a Highway Assist feature, they scrapped it because it got in the way of the fully autonomous driving goals that drive their vision.

## Detroit versus Silicon Valley culture around cars 

Detroit wasn’t originally on board with AVs. They felt that people *liked* driving. Self-driving vehicles would take this pleasure away. Detroit auto people loved the feel of a car’s acceleration, handling around curves, the roar of the engine. They're very much an auto-loving culture of people who love driving, love the purr of the engines. They didn't understand Silicon Valley’s desire to take this away. 

In Detroit's mind, cars connect closely with American values of freedom. Cars enable [[mobility]], which is the ability to get from place to place, anywhere you want. Cars allow people to live farther out, to commute to work, to get around. Cars transform personal mobility, giving people freedom. 

It took a while to come around to the idea, but Detroit eventually realized that while people might love driving on open roads, no one loved their commute. The commute was draining and wasted time. And having so many cars enter the city only to remain parked/unused all day was highly inefficient.

## Challenges with alternative propulsion systems

Getting on board with alternative propulsion systems (e.g., electric vehicles) and autonomous driving, however, was only the start. How to make it a reality for everyone is the challenge. 

Henry Ford’s innovation was not just the assembly line, but making cars affordable to the middle class. Previously, cars were limited to the wealthy, while most workers took public transportation and lived downtown. When Ford brought down the price of vehicles, making them affordable, the auto industry took off. That affordability innovation with EVs has held back more innovation and progress in this area. Automakers can make EVs, just not affordable ones.

Burns was an early proponent of the transformation of automobiles to alternative propulsion sources, to [[electric vehicles]]. He helped push GM in the direction of EVs and to explore models of urban driving. But alternative propulsion systems were expensive, too cost prohibitive to work. 

GM and Detroit were wary about the effort, then the auto industry suffered a financial crisis in 2008. They weren't financially able to keep pouring money into research and experimentation for something that might not even work out. Automakers were just trying to stay afloat and needed sell cars to remain solvent. 

## Lost opportunities 

In trying to remain afloat financially, Detroit lost out on a golden opportunity to get a jump on EV development at the right time. Detroit didn’t seize the moment before the auto trends shifted directions.

In contrast, Google continued to pour money into AV development. Google almost struck a deal with Ford, but Ford didn’t contribute enough on their side to make it worth it for Google. 

Google’s initial project for developing EVs was called Chauffeur. Started sometime in 2005-ish? Not sure. Eventually google started developing a highway driver assist feature, and wanted to test it. In 2013, dogfooded it with employees. Found that people just fell asleep or became inattentive. Pulled the plug on this feature due to safety concerns. Worried that crashes would jeopardize testing efforts, lose trust with the public. Also wanted to keep focus on transportation as a service, not as advanced tech in cars to assist with drivers driving private vehicles. Continued work on AV models. 

Some fear in Detroit that Google would entirely disrupt the automotive industry. Consequences would be massive. Detroit would periodically buy competitive EV cars and strip them down to every nut and bolt to analyze them. One day Burns had a major realization. Electric cars had a tenth the number of parts as combustion engines. Fewer parts, mostly a computer sitting on a skateboard. Wondered what the role of Detroit would be with AVs. Would Detroit be a packager? What value would they add? With combustion engines, there were a lot of parts and a high degree of complexity to get them working in harmony, to create a vehicle that could withstand years of driving, rough weather, and other abuse. Not an easy feat to pull off. 

Eventually Detroit got on board with the AV movement. Not sure exactly what the turning point was, but there was some concern that they would be left behind. That Silicon Valley would basically replace Detroit. Detroit began collaborating with software companies. 

Also major realization that cars were becoming heavily software driven, and auto computers didn’t have expertise in developing software. Different model entirely. Also realized the importance of high-fidelity map data to guide AV logic. Made a lot of sense for a company like google to be in this space – map data, software expertise, working on disruptive technology, deep pockets to fund the AV programming needed to pull off the impossible, safety conscious.

Tesla wasn’t safety conscious. Pushed out vehicles with lofty promises, not fully tested (e.g., can’t recognize vehicles traveling sideways on freeways, like a crossing tractor), crashes killed passengers (who poured too much confidence into Tesla), brought scrutiny with safety agencies, and set back AVs from more adoption and support quite a few years. In contrast, Google has been testing self-driving vehicles for 7+ years with only a tiny little fender bender accident. 

Burns has a strong belief that the transportation as a service model will work. 4 trillion dollar industry. Calculates cost of savings per mile. Key turning point will be when the cost of not owning a car is significantly less and you can still get around everywhere. Driverless cars enable that b/c right now, most of the money for the ride goes to the driver. Other money goes to gas. So several ideas come together in a powerful way to disrupt the industry:
Alternative propulsion (EVs), provide cheap replacement of gasoline
AV technology removes driver, reducing cost of the ride. Ride-hailing apps provide model for transportation as a service model.

Burns describes the math, a brief tour about the calculations that go into making everything work. Decides that there would be fewer cars on the road, and these cars could provide door to door service for everyone. Math seemed rushed and penned by someone who is overly optimistic and dreamer about this technology.

Burns in love with the idea of being part of such a wonderful transformation. Allows everyone to experience mobility (young and old), no longer restricted just to people who can drive. Wears rose-colored glasses. Gives nod to many people soon to be out of work, but explains that with each tech shift, new jobs / roles were created and people just have to find a way to transition. Shift from carriage repair workers to auto repair workers, for example.

There’s a sense of an author trying to tell a story on the cusp of the revolution. Feels like AVs are just about ready to roll out, and he wanted to tell the story of how it all came about, and of course he played a role in it all. Needs more of a reality check about AVs as potentially being a failure and a money pit, and how the idea that everyone can be chauffeured around in their own car and not have huge congestion everywhere is an idea that is hard to swallow.

Super cruise, Argo AI, Mobileeye, 

Great summary of the history of Waymo. Endless championing from google for this model. Never quite sure why. Business opportunity much larger than google itself? Use tech to change the world? Seems like a lot of effort to develop a technology that might not actually help the world all that much. Details about lewandowski. Told from an insider point of view. Not going to find this information elsewhere, so it’s an important book.

Huge shift to move away from oil dependence. Will involve massive disruption to world markets. Positive for the US except for Texas. Not enough about the need for EV infrastructure and power grid as replacement. 


AVs could be useful for many other scenarios. In _Autonomy: The Quest to Build the Driverless Car―And How It Will Reshape Our World_, the motivations for AV development seem much more focused on [military scenarios](https://fedtechmagazine.com/article/2021/07/autonomous-vehicles-may-cover-soldiers-airmen-dangerous-places), allowing self-driving Humvees to navigate in war zones without risking the life of soldiers. (Of course, autonomy in war can easily lead to massive clashes where remotely operated tanks and drones engage emotionlessly in battle &mdash; one step away from a _Black Mirror_ episode, but I digress.)

Even outside of war, there are many use cases for self-driving vehicles, such as lunar rovers, bomb-defusing robots, hazardous waste cleanup, coal mine mapping, security monitoring, and more. Even when technology sometimes fails in one goal, the tech can be serendipitously used for another. 



Google sections: 4-6, 74-76, 89-90
- Page studies at Univ of Michigan, grandfather works in GM plan. introduced to transportation issues from 1991-1995 in Ann Arbor. "Page became obsessed with alternative solutions. Those interminable minutes that Page spent waiting for the bus in the Michigan winter convinced him to draft, as a U of M student, an idea for a personal rapid-transportation system, an interconnected monorail on which two-person mobility pods were available on a moment's notice to ferry riders where they wished." 5 Page joined a solar-car racing team. Page almost studied autonomous car development instead of search engines. 4-6

Author is "VP of research, developingment, and planning. "I felt like it was my *responsibility* to accelerate the development of alternatives to the current transportation system." 6 major issues he wants to tackle: "oil dependence, safety issues, traffic congestion, and global warming -- these and other ills were solvable ... if only we'd transform the auto industry." 7

see the transportation industry entering period of disruption due to convergence of "three separate but related factors -- shared-use vehicles, powered by electric motors, and driven autonomously." 8 "Driverless technology," the "electrification of motor vehicles" (removing oil dependence), and "transportation as a service (Uber, Lyft, etc)" 102. "thanks for these converging forces, we're at an inflection point, a once-in-a-century opportunity to redefine not just the auto industry, but personal mobility itself." 102

vision: use an app to summon a driverless car to take you to any destination. 102

see the disruption as a huge financial shift in having automakers sell cars to people for private ownership to automakers controlling fleets of cars and not having private ownership. "self-driving taxis." 9 

Page and Brin are super supportive of AV development efforts and DARPA trials.

Making the car affordable was Ford's great innovation that launched the car's popularity. EVs face the same challenge. 104. 

car industry depends on road building and infrastructure for vitality. 106

The innovation of the car was that "It offered freedom on the cheap: You could go where you want to, when you want to, all at a reasonable cost.... Today, similarly nascent innovations -- autonomous technology, alternative-propulsion methods and the ride-sharing business model of transportation--will have a similarly transformative effect on the way people get around." 107



The author spent 3 decades in GM Research Laboratories. GM has most GAS implementations.

cars = freedom

The author's cochlear implant that returns his hearing makes him a believer in technology's ability to transform lives.

says mistake with EV development was to not realize that "profitability wouldn't come until several vehicle generations down the road" 119

Future of cars vision: the author is excited to "re-envision the way Americans move around and interact" 120.

The author calls their EV concept car "Autonomy" "because freedom is what automobiles are all about." 122. The author sees the automobile industry as providing freedom and autonomy to individuals about their mobility -- going places, on their own terms and wills. That's kind of cool. "Today, one hundred years after the automobile's invention... only twelve percent of the people in the world enjoy the freedom benefits of personal transportation ... Autonomy offers the promise of extending this freedom to even more people." 124

"With just one-tenth the parts, the electric vehicle was a lot easier to make. Not only did an electric vehicle have fewer parts, it also had far fewer *moving* parts than a conventional automobile. ... Electric vehicles would require far fewer employees to assemble the vehicle. Like, one-tenth the number of employees' ' 131. (seems to run counter to Musk's challenge of manufacturing EVs.)

"The crucial expertise in electric vehicles was software.... These projects would be engineered not by experts in the vagaries of the internal-combustion engine, but by programmers expert in the same ones and zeroes that ran your computer...." 132 From ICE to batter, then shift from mechanics to programmers. 

"A GM that continued with business as usual risked becoming little more than a packager. A tuner. A sales channel, which took other companies' valuable expertise and basically repackaged it into the vehicles bought by consumers." 132-33

the vision: "Soon, personal mobility will be dominated by transportation-as-a-service models, akin to self-driving versions of today's Uber or Lyft ride-sharing services. Fleet operators will own their vehicles throughout a 300,000-mile use cycle." 135

quote from someone: "Cars are great for going long distances... BUt it makes no sense at all for people in cities to use a 4,000-lb. piece of metal to haul their 150-lb. asses around town." 140 author talking about Segway. different vehicles excel in different environments. 140. SUVs are great for cross-country trip, while Segway good for going through dense urban areas and short distances.

gas prices changed consumer preferences. 145 
to stay alive, you have to make $ and sell cars. you can't pursue EVs if they are not profitable. It's the innovator's dilemma. 146 this is a constant conundrum.

The author receives a lot of backlash about PUMA, a concept for a Personal Urban Mobility and Accessibility vehicle (top speed 35mph, seats 2). lots of backlash toward GM due to gas-guzzling SUVs that it creates. "What I hadn't expected was how hostile some of the people would be to anything that General Motors did." 150

in nytimes article about his departure, burns is described as "the company's champion of electric and hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles." 153


Bill Mitchell, Reinventing the Automobile: Personal Urban Mobility for the 21st Century. "Mitchell regarded contemporary cities as broken--and the thing that had broken them was the automobile.... *Reinventing the Automobile** stated my feelings on the automobile's situation a lot more bluntly than I might have put it had I stayed at GM. Teh book described how much trouble cars caused the world, and argued that a new iteration of autombile represented a powerful part of the solution to these problems. ...[The old automobile was ICE-powered, the new would be electric and autonomous.]" 154

was asked if GM could fund a joint venture to further AV driving DARPA research. "...at that point, in 2008, GM was devoting all its energy to surviving historically low consumer automobile demand. Nearly all of my fellow GM executives considered autonomous cars to be a half century away; at least-- if they even considered the possibility at all. With the specter of bankruptcy looming, there was no way I could gather the budget required to pursue the opportunity, a fact that I regret to this day. And the other major automakers were too busy fighting bankruptcy as well." 160

Here comes Google and its deep pockets to save the day. 

seems like GPS came out around 2008? smartphones and GPS revolutionized things. Google's Ground Truth project: StreetView imagery? Street View imagery can aid with ground truth ("the truth of what you see on the ground")
 161

Levandowski -- has tech to marry Street View to location info. 164

"Look, Sebastian," Thrun recalls Page telling him, "you should work on self-driving cars. "Why?" Thrun asked. "Well," Page said, "if this business succeeds, it could be bigger than Google. Which means, even if there's just a ten percent chance of this succeeding, it's worth the investment." 165-66

Thrumsen told Page, "It's too hard. It can't be done." But Larry Page came back the next day. "I've thought about this. Give me a technical reason why it can't be done. Not a societal reason. A *technical* reason." Page was looking for something definitive. Something like, today's computers aren't yet powerful enough to process that data required to safely navigate a highway at legal speed.... [Thrun says it can't be done.] And still Page wouldn't take no for an answer. ... So Thrun went home and tried to think of a technical reason. And he couldn't. 'Shit,' he said to Page the next day. 'I can't really think of a technical reason.... The thought is certain to have occurred to Thrun--what sort of technical feats might be possible with the sort of budget Google's backing could provide?' 166-67

People wonder what Google's interest is in cars. They are, after all, a search engine company. "Google's project, Urmson argued, could transform the world. Could transform the way billions of regular people around the planet went from place to place." 169

"Google's development of the Street View service stands as a cartographic achievement unmatched since the days of Vasco da Gama and Magellan. ... The Street View project made possible Ground Truth, and excellent and accurate location-based search, because Google could use artificial intelligence and computer-vision software to pull from the Street View data the real-world location of every retailer, restaurant and address in any area it service. ... It also could be used to provide people with navigation directions." 172

Google projects: Street View, Ground Truth, Chauffeur

"...Street View and its successor program, Ground Truth, represented an important step in the development of autonomous-driving technology --because Chauffeur's approach to the safe and reliable deployment of self-driving cars required highly accurate maps of the roads its vehicles navigated.... Having map data let you do some *amazing* stuff..." 172-73

"The car would also compare its preexisting list of stationary objects with the objects around it to discover which ones were likely to move -- helping the car differentiate between a mailbox and a pedestrian, or a light pole and a cyclist. [for new shapes not on previous scans, it could be a pedestrian or cyclist.]" 173

map data helps sensors confirm what they're seeing. 175ish

Some self-driving vehicles can navigate a course faster than a human. military applications. 182

The team gets google's funding at a time when automakers are bankrupt. problem: testing on public streets. 186

"Larry and Sergey founded Google because they wanted to help solve really big problems using technology... And one of the big problems we're working on today is care safety and efficiency. Our goal is to help prevent traffic accidents, free up people's time and reduce carbon emissions by fundamentally changing car use.... While this project is very much in the experimental stage, it provides a glimpse of what transportation might look like in the future thanks to advanced computer science. And that future is very exciting." 190 quote from article about testing AV cars in public. https://www.channel4.com/news/google-tests-car-that-drives-itself

People in Detroit are confused about the purpose of a self-driving car. "What's the point of what? People *like* to drive." 191. 

Google tries to partner with Detroit, but Detroit is not interested. 197

"It was extraordinary threatening to people who have grown up in the auto industry to contemplate taking the driver out of the equation.... If I talked to Detroit CEOs and told them I was working on a self-driving car, they would give me a smile and walk away." 199


Tesla redefined attitudes toward EVs. 209. no longer lightweight, slow, tiny. Tesla pits Silicon Valley against Detroit. "It may have been the first company to pit Silicon Valley against Detroit." 209

He sees ride hailing apps another piece in the disruptive forces that can change our mobility. 210. This is one of "four disruptive forces that had been unleashed on the American transportation system." 215

the four disruptive forces: "DARPA, Carnegie Mellon, Stanford and Google had demonstrated that autonomous vehicles were viable. GM's EN-V concept, a star of the Shanghai World Expo, had highlighted the promise of vehicles tailor-designed for our most frequent trips instead of being over-designed to handle all conceivable trips. Zipcar, Lyft and Uber were divorcing Americans from the idea that you had to down the vehicle you rode in. And Tesla was making electric vehicles mainstream. Individually, each of the trends offered significant improvement over the 130-year-old automobile transportation system. But I was more interested in what could result from combining them. I sensed a new age of automobility was imminent. I believed this new age promised better mobility and safety for more people at lower personal and environment cost, and I wanted to more deeply understand the impacts of the convergence." 215-16

Burns' vision is one of a fleet of robotaxis you can summon at will. 218

"In every case, a shared fleet size equal to about 15 percent of the number of cars owned in these cities would provide responsive and efficient mobility service." 223

"All told, our calculations suggested that employing a shared driverless and electric mobility solution could save a driver $5,625 a year, plus the value of all the time that not driving frees up." 225

"The new age of automobility promises to profoundly improve the way regular people live their daily lives. It democratizes the benefits of convenient, whenever-you-want, wherever-you-want transportation to people who couldn't previously afford it: the very young and the very old ..." 227

He says this transportation revolution was mostly a missed opportunity from automakers. But "... one company did listen. Not coincidentally, this was the same company that was further ahead than anyone else in developing autonomous vehicles for consumers. That company was Google. And the reason they were listening was because Larry Page and Sergey Brin deeply believed that this thing was possible." 232-33

Early testing of Chauffeur with Google employees dogfooding it revealed that it "lulled its operators into a relaxed state..." 238. Chauffeur stops with the highway driver's assist b/c testing it is too hard and it wasn't the original goal of disrupting transportation -- it would just make commuting more convenient. 238  Soon the Chauffeur team scraps Highway Assistant "so that they could concentrate on solving the entire problem: creating a self-driving car that could handle every aspect of an automobile's operation..." 239

After a test drive of Firefly (an early Waymo prototype?) Brin says... "'Regardless of Google,' Brin told Markoff, 'I think the right model for most of the world will be not through vehicle ownership ... These should be provided as services for the most part." 261

AV will make ride hailing services so cheap that it will be much better than owning a car. So AV tech will unlock transportation as a service and make private car ownership antiquated.  Kalanick (Uber founder) says. "... so the magic there is that you basically bring the cost down below the cost of ownership. For *everybody*. And then car ownership goes away." 266

Kalanick (Uber): "There's real advancement for how cities work, and how people *move* in cities, that is going to change our lives." 267

"Before, mobility was a commodity in the form of individual cars that the companies sold. In the future, mobility was a *service* the companies would operate over time." 272 automakers transition to fleet operators.

In 2016, GM bought Cruise Automation, an SV startup that GM plans to use to bring it into the autonomous future. 282

"GM had every opportunity to do what Google did in 2009--and it had even more of an opportunity to do what Uber did in 2015, which is to say, hire some of the best robotics minds in the world and point them at the rapid development of self-driving cars. GM, after all, had a long-standing relationship with Carnegie Mellon. Which raises the question: Why *didn't* they? In fact, why did it take Detroit as a whole, so long to realize the importance of this stuff?" 283

"Then there's the innovator's dilemma. It's really hard for big companies to disrupt themselves...." Chris Urmson: 'One of Google's gifts was that they didn't have a product in this space.... They didn't have to worry about how it fit into an existing portfolio. They could just focus on the next thing." 283, 284. 

Automakers realize that it's not the hardware makers that hold the power, but the software makers. "...it turned out that the real differentiator when it came to a computer was the software that was on the device -- and the power migrated to the OS makers, the Microsofts and Apples, until the hardware makers were little more than afterthoughts." 284-85

"...getting to full autonomy, the kind that allows you to think it's a good idea to make a car without a steering wheel or brakes, requires really good maps--a high-resolution 3-D scan of every road the self-driving car is going to ride, ever. Which, in the early days, would have seemed insurmountable to nearly any company or researcher that *wasn't* Google. ." 285

The author also sees the EV revolution as getting America out of oil dependence. 301 he also sees safety, esp. from growing distraction of smartphones, as key benefits. 302

The author praises Google's responsible testing of the AVs in contrast to Tesla, which is reckless. But testing is a major obstacle to bringing the cars to market. 311-12. 

"As an enthusiastic proponent of self-driving technology, I feel lucky that Larry Page and Sergey Brin funded the development of the technology long before Elon Musk ever automated the driving of his vehicles. Google conducted its self-driving tests on public roads for seven years without its systems being implicated in a single crash--and when it finally did come along, it was a fender bender that occurred at 2 mph." 315

"The enmity that once characterized the relationship between Silicon Valley and Detroit has given way to a spirit of collaboration." 319

Cruise Automation --> GM
Argo AI --> Ford
Mobileye --> Tesla
Waymo --> Alphabet (Google)

Bob Lutz, chairman of GM, publishes an essay in Automotive News. "The era of the human-driven automobile, its repair facilities, its dealerships, the media surrounding it -- all will be gone in 20 years... The end state will be the fully autonomous module with no capability for the driver to exercise command." 324


"... it's hard to imagine a future that sees the major automakers with their market capitalizations in the tens of billions of dollars ever outright beating the technology companies, like Alphabet, Apple and Amazon, with values that bob in the middle hundred billions." 324

## Reading experience: 

Author narrates experiences, but written by co-writer. 
Lots of detail about the original DARPA races that was kind of boring. Occupies first 100 pages. 
Burns’ insider experience is fascinating. Has 3 decades as head of R&D in GM, right through these transformative times. Insider view of everything going on. Also worked as consultant for google.
Writing style is not the best. Always tries to describe the personality of the person before quoting. 
Burns has endless optimism for 




## Questions

What is Google's vision of the future of transportation? After a test drive of Firefly (an early Waymo prototype?) Brin says... "'Regardless of Google,' Brin told Markoff, 'I think the right model for most of the world will be not through vehicle ownership ... These should be provided as services for the most part." 261. see also p. 262-63

Why is Google involved in the automotive industry? Is google trying to solve transportation, offering a way for mobility for all, or does google see a massive business opportunity? or both?  see also p. 262-63

Does Geo Auto pursue Page's vision with autonomous vehicles? it seems we shifted to luxury EVs with autopilot modes, rather than the original vision of transforming what transportation looks like. Why? Tesla?

The author's excitement toward EVs is the vision of a transportation network with cars that aren't privately owned. What happened to that vision? It seems all OEMs are not really embracing the fleet model of AVs, but rather just implementing autopilots to copy Tesla. I can get excited about AV fleets, but not so much about every OEM having its own luxury EV version of a Tesla copy.

The author feels remorse at having missed the opportunity to develop viable EV models during pivotal historical times. But during those times, automakers were squeezed by financial pressure to sell cars just to stay afloat. How do companies sink time into R&D that might not pay off until a generation later while simultaneously staying afloat in the present? This is the innovator's dilemma. "Just at the moment that I could so clearly see that technology stood to solve many of the auto's big problems -- the automobile industry was cratering." 152 Also p. 283: GM had long relationships with Carnegie Mellon (robotics experts involved in AV development). "GM had every opportunity to do what Google did in 2009--and it had even more of an opportunity to do what Uber did in 2015, which is to say, hire some of the best robotics minds in the world and point them at the rapid development of self-driving cars. GM, after all, had a long-standing relationship with Carnegie Mellon. Which raises the question: Why *didn't* they? In fact, why did it take Detroit as a whole, so long to realize the importance of this stuff?" 283


"The enmity that once characterized the relationship between Silicon Valley and Detroit has given way to a spirit of collaboration." 319 How did this happen?
