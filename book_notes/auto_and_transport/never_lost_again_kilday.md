"My wife, Shelley, at home with a screaming baby, had already called twice. 'Where are you?' In frustration, I pounded my fist against my car's dashboard, yelling at nobody but myself, while driving five miles in the wrong direction down Route 2, looking for the next roundabout. Or maybe it was 3A? From 2000 to 2003, I lived in Boston -- and I was frequently turned around. The city was merciless to a transplanted Texan: It was like a foreign language. the locals seemed to take pride in the missing signage, serpentine streets, and roundabouts. You needed to solve a math equation to navigate some intersections." xi

"*Twenty-five percent* of all queries being typed into the simple white Google search box were looking for a map.

And guess what? Google had no map.

Searches like 'best margarita, Austin,' 'hotel in New Orleans,' 'heart attack near zip code 78636' were representing a significant share of all Google traffic. As late as January of 2005, if you entered those searches looking for a location or directions on the Google home page, Google returned a list of ten website links, with a a *Goooooogle next* button on the bottom, leaving its users still in need of a map and directions." (xv)

Author profile of Bill Kilday: "He has a terrible sense of direction."

Review by Antonio Garcia-Martinez][1]


"In 2007... Google Maps became the killer app of Apple's killer new device: the iPhone, with Steve Jobs personally demanding the inclusion and implementation of Google Maps." (xvi)
