## What’s the author’s main argument?

Story of self-driving vehicle tech is one in which Detroit was initially resistant, came to see the light too late in the game due to their love of driving. Silicon Valley capitalized on a convergence of several aligning factors – alternative propulsion, AV technology, distributed ride hailing services – all of which aligned to give rise to a major transformation of the auto industry that promises to offer mobility to everyone at a cheaper cost. Book is more about telling the story of change from inside the vantage point of Detroit over several pivotal decades and the challenges of developing self-driving technology. Tells story of [[Google]]’s involvement from the beginning, including [[Waymo]].

## Who is the author?

Spent 3 decades at GM, has tremendous insider knowledge. Also consultant for Google during Chauffer project. Provides details not likely to find elsewhere.

## How did efforts for self-driving technology begin?

DARPA

Starts with origins of self-driving initiatives, begins with DARPA. Initiative from military to spur development of self-driving technology for military vehicles. Feeling that this technology could save soldiers’ lives by removing them from explosive devices, mines, etc. 

Initiatives evolved into transportation as well. Insistence from Brin and Page that technology could solve big problems. Persuaded lead engineers that if there wasn’t a technical reason preventing autonomous models from working, then they should do it. Google founders saw huge opportunity for a disruptive transformation with the auto-industry. Even if just a 0% chance of success, felt like they had to take it. Page and Brin seem invested from the earliest days, even feeling personally connected to a solution from being stuck in Michigan waiting for a bus that never came (or something).

From earliest days, the vision was to reinvent mobility, to disrupt how transportation worked to a fully driverless model with transportation as a service (not privately owned autonomous vehicles).

Detroit wasn’t on board from the start. Felt that people liked driving. Self-driving vehicles would take this pleasure away. Detroit auto people love the feel of a car’s acceleration, handling around curves, the roar of the engine. Very much an auto-loving people who love driving, love the purr of the engines. Didn’t understand Silicon Valley’s desire to take this away. 

Took a while to come around to the idea, but eventually realized that while people might love driving on open roads no one loved their commute. The commute was draining, wasted time. Inefficiency of having so many cars enter the city only to remain parked/unused all day.

Henry Ford’s innovation was not just the assembly line, but making cars affordable to the middle class. Previously, cars were limited to the rich and most workers took public transportation and lived downtown. When Ford brought down the price of vehicles, making them affordable, the auto industry took off.

Cars represent freedom for people. They enabled [[mobility]], which is the ability to get from place to place, anywhere you want. Cars allowed people to live farther out, to commute in to work, to get around. Cars transformed personal mobility, giving people freedom. 

Burns was an early proponent of the transformation of automobiles to alternative propulsion sources, to EVs. He helped push GM in the direction of EVs and to explore models of urban driving. But alternative propulsion systems were expensive, too cost prohibitive to work. GM and Detroit were wary about the effort, then the auto industry suffered a financial crisis in 2008. Wasn’t financially able to keep pouring money into research and experimentation toward something that might not even work out. Automakers just trying to stay afloat, sell cars. However, they lost out on a golden opportunity to get a jump on EV development at the right time. Detroit didn’t seize the moment at the right time.

In contrast, Google continued to pour money into AV development. Almost struck a deal with Ford, but Ford didn’t contribute enough on their side to make it worth it for Google. Google’s initial project for developing EVs was called Chauffer. Started sometime in 2005-ish? Not sure. Eventually google started developing a highway driver assist feature, wanted to test it. In 2013, dogfooded it with employees. Found that people just fell asleep or became inattentive. Pulled the plug on this feature due to safety concerns. Worried that crashes would jeopardize testing efforts, lose trust with public. Also wanted to keep focus on transportation as a service, not as advanced tech in cars to assist with drivers driving private vehicles. Continued work on AV models. 

Some fear in Detroit that Google would entirely disrupt the automotive industry. Consequences would be massive. Detroit would periodically buy competitive cars and strip them down to every nut and bolt to analyze them. One day Burns had major realization. Electric cars had a tenth the number of parts as combustion engines. Fewer parts, mostly a computer sitting on a skateboard. Wondered what the role of Detroit would be with AVs. Would Detroit be a packager? What value would they add? With combustion engines, there was a lot of parts and high degree of complexity to get them working in harmony, to create a vehicle that could withstand years of driving, harsh weather, and other abuse. Not an easy feat to pull off. 

Eventually Detroit got on board with the AV movement. Not sure exactly what the turning point was, but there was some fear that they would be left behind. That Silicon Valley would basically replace Detroit. Detroit began collaborating with software companies. 

Also major realization that cars were becoming heavily software driven, and auto computers didn’t have expertise in developing software. Different model entirely. Also realized the importance of high-fidelity map data to guide AV logic. Made a lot of sense for a company like google to be in this space – map data, software expertise, working on disruptive technology, deep pockets to fund the AV programming needed to pull off the impossible, safety conscious.

Tesla wasn’t safety conscious. Pushed out vehicles with lofty promises, not fully tested (e.g., can’t recognize vehicles traveling sideways on freeways, like a crossing tractor), crashes killed passengers (who poured too much confidence into Tesla), brought scrutiny with safety agencies, and set back AVs from more adoption and support quite a few years. In contrast, Google has been testing self-driving vehicles for 7+ years with only a tiny little fender bender accident. 

Burns has strong belief that the transportation as a service model will work. 4 trillion dollar industry. Calculates cost of savings per mile. Key turning point will be when cost of not warning a car is significantly less and you can still get around everywhere. Driverless cars enable that b/c right now, most of the money for the ride goes to the driver. Other money goes to gas. So several ideas come together in a powerful way to disrupt the industry:
Alternative propulsion (EVs), provide cheap replacement of gasoline
AV technology removes driver, reducing cost of the ride. 
Ride-hailing apps provide model for transportation as a service model.

Burns describes the math, a brief tour about the calculations that go into making everything work. Decides that there would be fewer cars on the road, and these cars could provide door to door service for everyone. Math seemed rushed and penned by someone who is overly optimistic and dreamer about this technology.

Burns in love with idea of being part of such a wonderful transformation. Allows everyone to experience mobility (young and old), no longer restricted just to people who can drive. Wears rose-colored glasses. Gives nod to many people soon to be out of work, but explains that with each tech shift, new jobs / roles were created and people just have to find a way to transition. Shift from carriage repair workers to auto repair workers, for example

There’s a sense of an author trying to tell a story on the cusp of the revolution. Feels like AVs are just about ready to roll out, and he wanted to tell the story of how it all came about, and of course he played a role in it all. Needs more of a reality check about AVs as potentially being a failure and a money pit, and how the idea that everyone can be chauffeured around in their own car and not have massive congestion everywhere is an idea that is hard to swallow.

Super cruise, Argo AI, Mobileeye, 

Great summary of history of waymo. Endless championing from google for this model. Never quite sure why. Business opportunity much larger than google itself? Use tech to change the world? Seems like a lot of effort to develop a technology that might not actually help the world all that much. Details about lewandowski. Told from insider point of view. Not going to find this information elsewhere, so it’s am important book.

Huge shift to move away from oil dependence. Will involve massive disruption to world markets. Positive for US except for Texas. Not enough about need for EV infrastructure and power grid as replacement.

Reading experience: 

Author narrates experiences, but written by co-writer. 
Lots of detail about original DARPA races that was kind of boring. Occupies first 100 pages. 
Burns’ insider experience if fascinating. Has 3 decades as head of R&D in GM, right through these transformative times. Insider view of everything going on. Also worked as consultant for google.
Writing style is not the best. Always tries to describe the personality of the person before quoting. 
Burns has endless optimism for
