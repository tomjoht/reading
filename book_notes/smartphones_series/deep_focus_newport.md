# Deep Work, by Cal Newport


"Deep Work: Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate." 3

novelist doesn't respond to fan mail b/c he can either have a bunch of small email messages or a novel. 5

says network tools responsible for much of the fragmentation over deep work. "The reason knowledge workers are losing their familiarity with deep work is well established: network tools" 5

"This state of fragmented attention cannot accommodate deep work, which requires long periods of uninterrupted thinking. At the same time, however, modern knowledge workers are not loafing. In fact, they report that they are as busy as ever." 6

"Shallow Work: Non-cognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend to not create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate." 6

"In an age of network tools, ... knowledge workers increasingly replace deep work with the shall alternative--constantly sending and receiving email messages like human network routers, with frequent breaks for quick hits of distraction. Larger efforts that would be well served  by deep thinking.... get fragmented into distracted dashes that produce muted quality." 6

"Spend enough time in a state of frenetic shallowness and you *permanently* reduce your capacity to perform deep work." 7

"Our work culture's shift toward the shallow... is exposing a massive economic and personal opportunity for the few who recognize the potential of resisting this trend and prioritizing depth..." 8

easy way to check whether doing deep work: can your work be automated or performed by a bright young college grad? 9

"Deep work is so important that we might consider it, to use the phrasing of business writer Eric Barker, 'the superpower of the 21st century.'" 14

"The Deep Work Hypothesis: The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly *rare* at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly *valuable* in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive." 14

"Three to four hours a day, five days a week, of uninterrupted and carefully directed concentration, it turns out, can produce a lot of valuable output." 16

"...The lack of distraction in my life tones down that background hum of nervous mental energy that seems to increasingly pervade people's daily lives." 17

..."A deep life is a good life." 18

AI to replace shallow tasks. 23

ability to manipulate intelligent machines key. but mastering those machines requires deep learning. 24


"In this new economy, three groups will have a particular advantage: those who can work well and creatively with intelligent machines, those who are the best at what they do, and those with access to capital." 28

"Quoting Ericsson on experts versus normal performers. "...We argue that the differences between expert performers and normal adults reflect a life-long period of deliberate effort to improve performance in a specific domain." 34

notes that myelin in the brain forms with repeated firing in specific regions. deliberate practice creates neuro-specific changes that cement the skill. 36

"To produce at your peak level, you need to work for extended periods with full concentration on a single task free from distraction." 44. not even a glance at email every 10 min b/c this creates context switching and carries over "attention residue."

an open office culture with constant chat interferes with deep work. a paradox of the current work environment. 51

there's a "ubiquitous *culture of connectivity*, where one is expected to read and respond to e-mails (and related communication) quickly." 56

"The Principle of Least Resistance: In a business setting, without clear feedback on the impact of various behaviors to the bottom line, we will tend toward behaviors that are easiest in the moment." 58

people turn to busyness as a mirage of productivity. 64, 74. sending email, chat, little stuff all day. says is due to lack of clear metrics. knowledge workers don't have clear metrics so it's hard to gauge productivity, easy to mistake the appearance of busyness for someone who actually produces. "It can be hard to define exactly what a given knowledge worker does and how it differs from another." 74

"Depth-destroying behaviors such as immediate e-mail responses and an active social media presence are lauded, while avoidance of these trends generates suspicion." 75

we overestimate the utility of the internet 68. it gets equated with productivity, etc. in reality, much of internet is made by youngins trying to make a buck. "Deep work is exiled in favor of more distracting high-tech behaviors..." 69

"Our brains instead construct our worldview based on *what we pay attention to.*. ...Gallagher's theory, therefore, predicts that if you spend enough time in this state, your mind will understand your world as rich in meaning and importance." 77-79 Winifred Gallagher, "connection between attention and happiness" 76

"A workday driven by the shallow, from a neurological perspective, is likely to be a draining and upsetting day, even if most of the shallow things that capture your attention seem harmless or fun." 82

"...to increase the time you spend in a state of depth is to leverage the complex machinery of the human brain in a way that for several different neurological reasons maximizes the meaning and satisfaction you'll associate with your working life." 82

Quoting Csikszenmihalyi's work: "The best moments usually occur when a person'[s body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficulty and worthwhile." 84

"When measured empirically, people were happier at work and less happy relaxing than they suspected." 84

summarizing Csikszenmihalyi's theory of flow: "...the feeling of going deep is *in itself* very rewarding. Our minds like this challenge, regardless of the subject. ... the act of going deep orders the consciousness in a way that makes life worthwhile." 85

David Dewane's plan for the Eudaimonia Machine. architecture professor. "He imagines a process in which you spend ninety minutes inside, take a ninety-minute break, and repeat two or three times -- at which point you brain will have achieved its limit of concentration for the day." 97

"Unfortunately, when it comes to replacing distraction with focus, matters are not so simple. To understand why this is true let's take a closer look at one of the main obstacles to going deep: the urge to turn your attention toward something more superficial. Most people recognize that this urge can complicate efforts to concentrate on hard things, but most underestimate its regularity and strength." 98

"... you can expect to be bombarded with the desire to do anything *but* work deeply throughout the day..." 99

"This brings me to the motivating idea behind the strategies that follow: The key to developing a deep work habit is to move beyond good intentions and add *routines* and *rituals* to your working life designed to minimize the amount of your limited willpower necessary to transition into and maintain a state of unbroken concentration. ... if you deployed smart routines and rituals--perhaps a set time and quiet location used for your deep tasks each afternoon--you'd require much less willpower to start and keep going. In the long run, you'd therefore succeed with these deep efforts far more often." 100

"You must be careful to choose a philosophy that fits your specific circumstances, as a mismatch here can derail your deep work habit before it has a chance to solidify." 102

Stephenson sees two mutually exclusive options: He can write good novels at a regular rate, or he can answer a lot of individual e-mails and attend conferences, and as a result produce lower-quality novels at a slower rate." 105

measuring productivity seems key -- for writer, it's the written word, the number of pages.

"Great minds like Caro and Darwin didn't deploy rituals to be weird; they did so because success in their work depended on their ability to go deep, again and again--there's no way to win a Pulitzer Prize or conceive a grand theory without pushing your brain to its limits. Their rituals minimized the friction in this transition to depth, allowing them to go deep more easily and stay in the state longer." 119

"As the authors of *The 4 Disciplines of Execution* explain, "The more you try to do, the less you actually accomplish." They elaborate that execution should be aimed at a small number of "wildly important goals." 136

For an individual focused on deep work, it's easy to identify the relevant lead measure: *time spent in a state of deep work dedicated toward your wildly important goal.* 138

"At the end of the workday, shut down your consideration of work issues until the next morning--no after dinner e-mail check, no mental replays of conversations, and no scheming about how you'll handle an upcoming challenge; shut down work thinking completely. If you need more time, then extend your workday, but once you shut down, your mind must be left free to encounter Krieder's buttercups, stink bugs, and stars." 144 the idea is that your unconscious can continue processing things. "...for decisions that involve large amounts of information and multiple vague, and perhaps even conflicting, constrains, your unconscious mind is well suited to tackle the issue." 145 "A shutdown habit, therefore, is not necessarily reducing the amount of time you're engaged in productive work, but is instead diversifying the type of work you deploy." 146

"The Role of Deliberate Practice in the Acquisition of Expert Performance," he dedicates a section to reviewing what the research literature reveals about an individual's capacity for cognitively demanding work. Ericsson notes that for a novice, somewhere around an hour a day of intense concentration seems to be a limit, while for experts this number can expand to as many as four hours -- but rarely more." 150 ... "The implication of these results is that your capacity for deep work in a given day is limited." 150

"The ability to concentrate intensely is a skill that must be trained." 157 ... "Efforts to deepen your focus will struggle if you don't simultaneously wean your mind from a dependence on distraction." 157

people who multitask lose the ability to filter out irrelevancy. they think they can focus when they need to, but "they just can't keep on task." quoting  Clifford Nass conversation with Ira Flatow on NPR. 158

"Once your brain has become accustomed to on-demand distraction, Nass discovered, it's hard to shake the addiction even when you *want* to concentrate. To put this more concretely: If every moment of potential boredom in your life -- say, having to wait five minutes in line or sit alone in a restaurant until a friend arrives -- is relieved with a quick glance at your smartphone, then your brain has likely been rewired to a point where, like the "mental wrecks' in Nas's research, it's not ready for deep work -- even if you regularly schedule time to practice this concentration. ... Once you're wired for distraction, you crave it" 158-60

"Schedule in advance when you'll use the Internet, and then avoid it altogether outside these times." I suggest that you keep a notepad near your computer at work. On this pad, record the *next* time you're allowed to use the Internet. Until you arrive at that time, absolutely no network connectivity is allowed -- no matter how tempting. The idea of motivating this strategy is that the use of a distracting service does not, by itself, reduce your brain's ability to focus. It's instead the constant *switching* from low-stimuli/high-value activities, at the slightest hint of boredom or cognitive challenge, that teaches your mind to never tolerate an absence of novelty. This constant switching can be understood analogously as weakening the mental muscles responsible for organizing the many sources vying for your attention." 161-2

"Regardless of how you schedule your Internet blocks, you must keep the time outside these blocks absolutely free from Internet use." 163

I need to strengthen my concentration muscles much more diligently than I currently do. time to make new rules.

"To summarize, to succeed with deep work you must rewire your brain to be comfortable resisting distracting stimuli. This doesn't mean that you have to eliminate distracting behaviors; it's sufficient that you instead eliminate the ability of such behaviors to hijack your attention." 165

On social media: "Identify the core factors that determine success and happiness in your professional and personal life. Adopt a tool only if its positive impacts on these factors substantially outweigh its negative impacts." 191

"For each such tool, go through the key activities you identified and ask whether the use of the tool has a *substantially positive impact, a substantially negative impact,* or * *little impact* on your regular and successful participation in the activity." 195

"In many settings, 80 percent of a given effect is due to just 20 percent of the possible causes." 201

"To abandon a network tool using this logic, therefore, is not to miss out on its potential small benefits, but is instead to get more out of the activities you already know to yield large benefits." 203

He encourages people to quit social media through a 30 day detox, like putting all your house's belongings into boxes into the garage. "Would the last thirty days have been notably better if I had been able to use this service? Did people care that I wasn't using this service?" 205

"This strategy picks specifically on social media because among the different network tools that can claim your time and attention, these services, if used without limit, can be particularly devastating to your quest to work deeper. They offer personalized information arriving on an unpredictable intermittent schedule--making them massively addictive and therefore capable of severely damaging your attempts to schedule and succeed with any act of concentration." 205

"But part of what makes social media insidious is that the companies that profit from your attention have succeeded with a masterful marketing coup: convincing our culture that if you don't use their products you might *miss out*." 206

"The reason why I ask you to not announce your thirty-day experiment is because for some people another part of the delusion that binds them to social media is the idea that people *want to hear what you have to say*, and that they might be disappointed if you suddenly leave them bereft of your commentary." 206

"These services aren't necessarily, as advertised, the lifeblood of our modern connected world. They're just products, developed by private companies, funded lavishly, marketed carefully, and designed ultimately to capture then sell your personal information and attention to advertisers. They can be fun, but in the scheme of your life and what you want to accomplish, they're a lightweight whimsy, one unimportant distraction among many threatening to derail you from something deeper." 209

"These sites are especially harmful after the workday is over, where the freedom in your schedule enables them to become central to your leisure time. If you're waiting in line, or waiting for the plot to pick up in a TV show, or waiting to finish eating a meal, they provide a cognitive crutch to ensure you eliminate any chance of boredom. ... such behavior is dangerous, as it weakens your mind's general ability to resist distraction, making deep work difficult later when you really want to concentrate." 212

says to avoid using the internet to entertain yourself. Instead, plan your leisure time. no need for complete escapism downtime. you can switch mental muscles and do something more rewarding and rejuvenating. "... if you want to eliminate the addictive pull of entertainment sites on your time and attention, give your brain a quality alternative." 214

"...once you've hit your deep work limit in a given day, you'll experience diminishing rewards if you try to cram in more. Shallow work, therefore, doesn't become dangerous until after you add enough to begin to crowd out your bounded deep efforts for the day....The typical workday is eight hours. The most adept deep thinker cannot spend more than four of these hours in a state of true depth. It follows that you can safely spend half the day wallowing in the shallows without adverse effect. The danger missed by this analysis is how *easily* this amount of time can be consumed, especially once you consider the impact of meetings, appointments, calls, and other scheduled events. For many jobs, these time drains can leave you with surprisingly little time left for solo work." 220

Newport recommends planning your day every minute. "Without structure, it's easy to allow your time to devolve into the shallow--e-mail, social media, Web surfacing. This type of shallow behavior, though satisfying in the moment, is not conducive to creativity." 227

In differentiating between deep and shallow work, ask, "How long would it take (in months) to train a smart recent college graduate with no specialized training in my field to complete this task?" 229

"I, too, an incredibly cautious about my use of the most dangerous word in one's productivity vocabulary: "yes"." 239

"Make People Who Send You E-mail Do More Work" 243

The sender filter up front requires people to do more work on their end -- 248. you could probably do this more effectively if you had a lot of forms asking people to complete when they request a documentation bug. otherwise you have to do this work.

"There are two common tropes bandied around when people discuss solutions to e-mail overload. One says that sending e-mails generates more e-mails, while the other says that wrestling with ambiguous or irrelevant e-mails is a major source of inbox-related stress." 256

"For many, there's a comfort in the artificial busyness of rapid e-mail messaging and social media posturing, while the deep life demands that you leave much of that behind. There's also an uneasiness that surrounds any effort to produce the best things you're capable of producing, as this forces you to confront the possibility that your best is not (yet) that good." 263

"But if you're willing to sidestep these comforts and fears, and installed struggle to deploy your mind to its fullest capacity to create things that matter, then you'll discover, as others have before you, that depth generates a life rich with productivity and meaning." 263
