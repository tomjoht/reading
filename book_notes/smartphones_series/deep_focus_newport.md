# Deep Work, by Cal Newport


"Deep Work: Porfessional activities performed in a state o distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate." 3

novelist doesn't respond to fan mail b/c he can either have a bunch of small email msgs or a novel. 5

says network tools responsible for much of the fragmentation over deep work. "The reason knowledge workers are losing their familiarity with deep work is well established: network tools" 5

"This state of fragmented attention cannot accommodate deep work, which requires long periods of uninterrupted thinking. At the same time, however, modern knowledge workers are not loafing. In fact, they report that they are as busy as ever." 6

Shallow Work: Noncognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend to not create much new value in the worl dand are easy to replicate." 6

"In an ageof network tools, ... knowledge workers increasingly replace deep work with the shall alternative--constantly sending and receiving email messages like human network routers, with frequent breaks for quick hits of distraction. Larger efforts that would be well served  by deep thinking.... get fragmented into distracted dashes that produce muted quality." 6

"Spend enough time in a state of frenetic shallowness and you *permanently* reduce your capacity to perform deep work." 7

"Our work culture's shift toward the shallow... is exposing a massive economic and personal opportuunity for the few who recognize the potential of resisting this trend and prioritizing depth..." 8

easy way to check whether doing deep work: can your work be automated or performed by a bright young college grad? 9

"Deep work is so important that we might consider it, to use the phrasing of business writer Eric Barker, 'the superpower of the 21st century.'" 14

"The Deep Work Hypothesis: The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly *rare* at ex*actly the same time it is becoming increasingly *valuable* in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive." 14

"Three to four hours a day, five days a week, of uninterrupted and carefully directed concentration, it turns out, can produce a lot of valuable output." 16

"...The lack of distraction in my life tones down that background hum of nervous mental energy that seems to increasingly pervade people's daily lives." 17

..."A deep life is a good life." 18

AI to replace shallow tasks. 23

ability to manipulate intelligent machines key. but mastering those machines requires deep learning. 24


"In this new economy, three groups will have a particular advantage: those who can work wlel and creatively with intelligent machines, those who are the best at what they do, and those with access to capital." 28

"Quoting Ericsson on experts versus normal performers. "...We argue that the differences between expert performers and normal adults reflect a life-long period of deliberate effort to improve performance in a specific domain." 34

notes that myelin in brain forms with repeated firing in specific region. deliberate practice creates neuro-specific changes that cement the skill. 36

"To produce at your peak level, you need to work for extended periods with full concentration on a single task free from distraction." 44. not even a glance at email every 10 min b/c this creates context switching and carries over "attention residue."

open office culture with constant chat interferes with deep work. a paradox of the current work environment. 51

there's a "ubiquitous *culture of connectivity*, where one is expected to read and respond to e-mails (and related communication) quickly." 56

"The Principle of Least Resistance: In a business setting, without clear feedback on the impact of various behaviors to the bottom line, we will tend toward behaviors that are easiest in the moment." 58

people turn to busyness as a mirage of productivity. 64, 74. sending email, chat, little stuff all day. says is due to lack of clear metrics. knowledge workers don't have clear metrics so it's hard to gauge productivity, easy to mistake the appearance of busyness for someone who actually produces. "It can be hard to define exactly what a given knowledge worker does and how it differs from another." 74

"Depth-destroying behaviors such as immediate e-mail responses and an active social media presence are lauded, while avoidance of these trends generates suspicion." 75

we overestimate the utility of the internet 68. it gets equated with productivity, etc. in reality, mucho f internet is made by youngens trying to make a buck. "Deep work is exiled in favor of more distracting high-tech behaviors..." 69

"Our brains instead contruct our worldview based on *what we pay attention to.*. ...Gallagher's theory, therefore, predicts that if you spend enough time in this state, your mind will understand your world as rich in meaing and importance." 77-79 Winifred Gallagher, "connection between attention and happiness" 76

"A workday driven by the shallow, from a neurological perspective, is likely to be a draining anbd upsetting day, even if most of the shallow things that capture your attention seem harmless or fun." 82

"...to increase the time you spend in a stat eof depth is to leverage the complex machinery of the human brain in a way that for several different neurological reasons maximizes the meaning and satisfaction you'll associate with your working life." 82

Quoting Csikszenmihalyi's work: "The best moments usually occur when a person'[s body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficulty and worthwhile." 84

"When measured empirically, people were happier at work and less happy relaxing than they suspected." 84

summarizing Csikszenmihalyi's theory of flow: "...the feeling of going deep is *in itself* very rewarding. Our minds like this challenge, regardless of the subject. ... the act of going deep orders the consioucness in a way that makes life worthwhile." 85

David Dewane's plan for the Eudaimonia Machine. architecture professor. "He imaginews a process in which you spend ninety minutes inside, take a ninety-minute break, and repeat two or three times -- at which point you rbrain will have achieved its limit of concentrat9ion for the day." 97

"Unfortunatelyt, when it comes to replacing distraction with focus, matters are not so simple. To understand why this is true let's take a closer look at one of the main obstacles to going deep: the urge to turn your attention toward something more superficial. Most people recognize that this urge can compliate efforts to concentrate on hard things, but most underestimate its regularity and strength." 98

"... you can expect to be
