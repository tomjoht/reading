"Nature loves a balance--but many times, human decision makers act contrary to these balances, and pay the price." talks about mgrs who cut staff to reduce expenses only to find they pay contractors more because the same amount of work is expected to get done, or spend more in overtime pay. "*the system has its own agenda*. There is an implicit goal, unspoken but very real--the amount of work that is expected to get done." 84

"Balancing feedback processes are everywhere. They underlie all goal-oriented behavior. Complex organisms such as the human body contain thousands of balancing feedback processes that maintain temperature and balance, heal our wounds, adjust our eyesight to the amount of light, and alert us to thread. A biologist would say that all of these processes are the mechanisms by which our body achieves *homeostasis*--its ability to maintain conditions for survival in a changing environment." 84


"... certain patterns of structure recur again and again. These 'systems archetypes' or 'generic structures' embody the key to learning to see structures in our personal and organizational lives." 93

Archetype 1: Limits to Growth: "A reinforcing (amplifying) process is set in motion to produce a desired result. It creates a spiral of success but also creates inadvertent secondary effects (manifested in a balancing process) which eventually slow down the success." 94

"In each case of limits to growth, there is a reinforcing (amplifying) process of growth or improvement that operates on its own for a period of time. Then it runs up against a balancing (or stabilizing process, which operates to limit the growth. When that happens, the rate of improvement slows down, or even comes to a standstill." 96

"When the rate of improvement slows down, you want to compensate by striving even harder. Unfortunately, the more vigorously you push the familiar levers, the more strongly the balancing process resists, and the more futile your efforts become." 100 Some start to lower their goal.

"But there is another way to deal with limits to growth situations. *In each of them, leverage lies in the balancing loop--not the reinforcing loop. To change the behavior of the system, you must identify and change the limiting factor.*  This may require actions you may not yet have considered, choices you never noticed, or difficult changes in rewards and norms." 100

"Is there a situation in which things get better and better at first, and then mysteriously stop improving? once you have such a situation in mind, see if you can identify the appropriate elements of the reinforcing and balancing loops." 101 the reinforcing action is what led to improvement, the balancing loop is what countered that improvement.

"Once you've mapped out your situation, look for the leverage. It won't involve pushing harder; that will just make the resistance stronger. More likely, it will require weakening or removing the limiting condition." 102

talks about cycle of addiction. people start drinking as a way to cope with some failure, and it sort of makes them feel good / escape, but then drinking creates its own problems. 104, 108


main takeaway: cycle of addiction, limits of growth, shifting the burden, mutualism.

application to documentation: 
- see every new addition as having impact on others
- why some problems exist? look at parts of entire system.
- how does this piece (this API) fit in and interact with all the other pieces? how does it influence the system?
- why are partners not implementing this API: look at the larger system at play.
- unifying vision for the product. when you have multiple product orgs each with differing visions.


there's a natural tendency to break apart problems to individual components as a way to manage them and troubleshoot, but this is misleading, distorting the nature of the system.

5 components:
- system thinking
- personal mastery
- mental models
- building shared vision
- team learning

"At the heart of a learning organization is a shift of mind--from seeing ourselves as separate from the world to connected to the world, from seeing problems as caused by someone or something "out there" to seeing how our own actions create the problems we experience. A learning organization is a place where people are continually discovering how they create their reality. And how they can change it." 12

..."problems are becoming increasingly complex and interconnected." 14


"When asked what they do for a living, most people describe the tasks they perform every day, not the *purpose* of the greater enterprise in which they take part. Most see themselves within a system over which they have little or no influence." 18

there are frequently siloes of responsibility and stewardship. success is focused only on the immediate ownership. 

when something goes wrong, we assign the blame to someone else, assume that the error lies outside our stewardship. there isn't a sense of responsibility for the whole.
