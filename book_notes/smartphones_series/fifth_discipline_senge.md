main takeaway: cycle of addiction, limits of growth, shifting the burden, mutualism.

application to documentation: 
- see every new addition as having impact on others
- why some problems exist? look at parts of entire system.
- how does this piece (this API) fit in and interact with all the other pieces? how does it influence the system?
- why are partners not implementing this API: look at the larger system at play.
- unifying vision for the product. when you have multiple product orgs each with differing visions.


there's a natural tendency to break apart problems to individual components as a way to manage them and troubleshoot, but this is misleading, distorting the nature of the system.

5 components:
- system thinking
- personal mastery
- mental models
- building shared vision
- team learning

"...we tend to focu on snapshots of isolated parts of the system, and wonder why our deepest problems never seem to get solved." 7

"At the heart of a learning organization is a shift of mind--from seeing ourselves as separate from the world to connected to the world, from seeing problems as caused by someone or something "out there" to seeing how our own actions create the problems we experience. A learning organization is a place where people are continually discovering how they create their reality. And how they can change it." 12


..."problems are becoming increasingly complex and interconnected." 14


"When asked what they do for a living, most people describe the tasks they perform every day, not the *purpose* of the greater enterprise in which they take part. Most see themselves within a system over which they have little or no influence." 18

"When asked what they do for a living, most people describe the tasks they perform every day, not the *purpose* of the greater enterprise in which they take part." 18

"When people in organizations focus only on their position, they have little sense of responsibility for the results produced when all positions interact. More over, when results are disappointing, it can be very difficult to know why. All you can do is assume that 'someone screwed up.'" 19

there are siloes of responsibility and stewardship. success is focused only on their immediate ownership

"When we focus only on our position, we do not see how our actions extend beyond the boundary of that position." 19

"*True proactiveness comes from seeing how we contribute to our own problems.* 21

seeing short-term events as the causes behind outcomes is not the best approach. "Such explanations may be true, but they distract us from seeing the longer-term patterns of change that lie behind the events and from understanding the causes of those patterns." 21

the biggest threat in an organization the gradual slow, long-term decay. "Learning to see slow, gradual processes requires slowing down our frenetic pace and paying attention to the subtle as well as the dramatic.... the gradual processes ... often pose the greatest threats." 23

"...*we learn best from experience but we never directly experience the consequences of many of our most important decisions." 23

+++++ companies break themselves into smaller parts, these siloes discourage analysis of problems that span across siloed groups. "Traditionarlly, organizations attempt to surmount the difficulty of copying with the breadth of impact from decisions by breaking themselves up into components. They institute functional hierarchies that are easier for people to 'get their hands around.' But functional divisions grow into fiefdoms, and what was once a convenient division of labor mutates into the 'stovepipes' that all but cut off contact between functions. The result: analysis of th emost important problems in a company, the complex issues that cross functional lines, becomes a perilous or nonexistence exercise." 24

"...most of those inside the empire sense that all is not quite right, but their instincts are to more strongly defend their traditional ways of doing things rather than to question them--let alone develop the capacity to change those ways." 26

key idea: people silo themselves into separate functions. when issues cross those lines, they fall through the cracks. there's lots of defensiveness and image protection. not questioning and self-examination and seeing how your group contributes to the problem. 

[the beer game] "Players' guesses regarding consumer demand shed light on our deeply felt need to find someone or something to blame when there are problems... ONce they see that they can no longer blame one another, or the customer, the players have one last recourse--*blame the system*." 46-47

there are frequently siloes of responsibility and stewardship. success is focused only on the immediate ownership. 

when something goes wrong, we assign the blame to someone else, assume that the error lies outside our stewardship. there isn't a sense of responsibility for the whole.


look at the structure of a system and see what structures might be creating patterns of behavior. "Structure produces behavior, and changing underlying structures can produce different patterns of behavior. In this sense, structural explanations are inherently *generative*." 53

analogy of pushing out the bump in the center of a carpet. 57. "Solutions that merely shift problems from one part of a system to another often goes undetected because, unlike the rug merchant, those who 'solved' the first problem are different from those who inherit the new problem. 58

Systems have "compensating feedback." This is "when well-intentioned interventions call forth responses from the system that offset the benefits of the intervention." 58

"Pushing harder and harder on familiar solutions, while fundamental problems persist or worsen, is a reliable indicator of nonsystematic thinking--what we often call the 'what we need here is a bigger hammer' syndrome.' 61

people implement short-term improvements that lead to long-term dependency, a phenomenon called "shifting the burden to the intervenor." 61

"Underlying all of the above problems is a fundamental characteristic of complex human systems: cause and effect are not close in time and space.... There is a fundamental mismatch between the nature of reality in complex systems and our predominant ways of thinking about the reality. The first step in correcting that mismatch is to let go of the notion that cause and effect are close in time and space." 63 

"Learning to see underlying structures rather than events is a starting point." 65

+++++"What makes this principle difficult to practice is the way organizations are designed to keep people from seeing important interactions. One obvious way is by enforcing rigid internal divisions that inhibit inquiry across divisional boundaries, such as those that grow up between marketing, manufacturing, and research." 67

"Systems thinking shows us that there is no separate 'other'; that you and the someone else are part of a single system." 67

+++++key idea: problems in a system are complex and cross boundaries. by siloing each group, the cross-product area nature of problems become harder to see. causes and effects aren't short-term and closely related, might be much more distant across org. need systems thinking to understand what's going on, to see the underlying structures. 

"Systems thinking is a discipline for seeing wholes. It is a framework for seeing interrelationships rather than things, for seeing patterns of change rather than static 'snapshots.'" 68

Systems thinking is a cornerstone idea that underlies all of the learning disciplines. "All are concerned with a shift of mind from seeing parts to seeing wholes, from seeing people as helpless reactors to reacting to the present to creating the future." 69

systems: 
- 1. personal mastery
- 2. mental models
- 3. shared vision
- 4. team learning
- 5. systems thinking

dynamic complexity: consequences of something manifest in distant part of org from the cause or change. non-obvious cause and effect, like a butterfly flapping its wings to cause a hurricane in another hemisphere. 71

gaps between actions and consequences make it difficult to understand causal relationships. 

ask, what is producing these patterns, not just one-time events? 

"...it requires seeing patterns of change, not just snapshots, such as the continuing escalation." 72

"The essence of the discipline of systems thinking lies in a shift of mind: seeing interrelationships rather than linear cause-effect chains, and seeing processes of change rather than snapshots." 73

there are certain structures that recur again and again in systems. 73

+++++ "Reality is made up of circles but we see straight lines. Herein lie the beginnings of our limitation as systems thinkers." 73

"The key to seeing reality systematically is seeing circles of influence rather than straight lines." 75

"In systems thinking it is an axiom that every influence is both *cause* and *effect*. Nothing is ever influenced in just one direction. 75

"When reading a feedback circle diagram, the main skill is to see the story that the diagram tells: how the structure creates a particular pattern of behavior." 76

"In mastering systems thinking, we give up the assumption that there is an individual, or individual agent, responsible. The feedback perspective suggests that *everyone shares responsibility for problems generated by a system*." 78

"Whenever you are in a situation where things are growing, you can be sure that reinforcing feedback is at work." 79

small actions, changes can grow into large consequences. 80

reinforcing processes: "a small change builds on itself. "A small action snowballs, with more and more and still more of the same, resembling compounding interest. Some reinforcing (amplifying) processes are 'vicious cycles,' in which things start off badly and grow worse." 81

"Extinctions of species often follow patterns of slow, gradually accelerating decline over long time periods, then rapid collapse. So do extinctions of corporations." 83 slow decline followed by rapid collapse -- vicious cycles can be subtle but the pattern of the accelerating change is powerful.

"Nature loves a balance--but many times, human decision makers act contrary to these balances, and pay the price." talks about managers who cut staff to reduce expenses only to find they pay contractors more because the same amount of work is expected to get done, or spend more in overtime pay. "*the system has its own agenda*. There is an implicit goal, unspoken but very real--the amount of work that is expected to get done." 84

"Balancing feedback processes are everywhere. They underlie all goal-oriented behavior. Complex organisms such as the human body contain thousands of balancing feedback processes that maintain temperature and balance, heal our wounds, adjust our eyesight to the amount of light, and alert us to thread. A biologist would say that all of these processes are the mechanisms by which our body achieves *homeostasis*--its ability to maintain conditions for survival in a changing environment." 84

"Delays, when the effect of one variable on another takes time, constitute the third basic building block for a systems language. Virtually all feedback processes have some form of delay." 89

specialization gets in the way of a unified system. "As we learn more about the systems archetypes, they will no doubt contribute toward one of our most vexing problems, a problem against which managers and leaders struggle incessantly--specialization and the fractionation of knowledge. In many ways, the greatest promise of the systems perspective is the unification of knowledge across all fields--for these same archtetypes recur in biology, psychology, and family therapy; in in economics, , political science, and econoolgoy; as well as in management." 93 specialzia

"... certain patterns of structure recur again and again. These 'systems archetypes' or 'generic structures' embody the key to learning to see structures in our personal and organizational lives." 93

Archetype 1: Limits to Growth: "A reinforcing (amplifying) process is set in motion to produce a desired result. It creates a spiral of success but also creates inadvertent secondary effects (manifested in a balancing process) which eventually slow down the success." 94

"We might 'solve' sudden deadline pressures by working longer hours; eventually, however, the added stress and fatigue slow down our work speed and quality, compensating for the longer hours." 95

"In each case of limits to growth, there is a reinforcing (amplifying) process of growth or improvement that operates on its own for a period of time. Then it runs up against a balancing (or stabilizing process, which operates to limit the growth. When that happens, the rate of improvement slows down, or even comes to a standstill." 96

"When the rate of improvement slows down, you want to compensate by striving even harder. Unfortunately, the more vigorously you push the familiar levers, the more strongly the balancing process resists, and the more futile your efforts become." 100 Some start to lower their goal.

"But there is another way to deal with limits to growth situations. *In each of them, leverage lies in the balancing loop--not the reinforcing loop. To change the behavior of the system, you must identify and change the limiting factor.*  This may require actions you may not yet have considered, choices you never noticed, or difficult changes in rewards and norms." 100

"Is there a situation in which things get better and better at first, and then mysteriously stop improving? once you have such a situation in mind, see if you can identify the appropriate elements of the reinforcing and balancing loops." 101 the reinforcing action is what led to improvement, the balancing loop is what countered that improvement.

"Once you've mapped out your situation, look for the leverage. It won't involve pushing harder; that will just make the resistance stronger. More likely, it will require weakening or removing the limiting condition." 102

talks about cycle of addiction. people start drinking as a way to cope with some failure, and it sort of makes them feel good / escape, but then drinking creates its own problems. 104, 108

"What 'slowing action' or resisting force starts to come into play to keep the condition from continually improving?" 102

"Archetype 2: Shifting the Burden Definition. An underlying problem generates symptoms that demand attention. But the underlying problem is difficult for people to address, either because it is obscure or costly to confront. So people “Shift the burden” of their problem to other solutions — well-intentioned, easy fixes which seem extremely efficient. Unfortunately, the easier “solutions” only ameliorate the symptoms; they leave the underlying problem unaltered. The underlying problem grows worse, unnoticed because the symptoms apparently clear up, and the system loses whatever abilities it had to solve the underlying problem.” (103)

people start drinking to solve the wrong problem. how do you know if your fix addresses the fundamental problem or if it just addresses a symptom of the fundamental problem? 

one way to falsely address the problem is to lower the goal. 107

"What makes the shifting the burden structure insidious is the subtle reinforcing cycle it fosters, increasing dependence on the symptomatic solution. Alcoholics eventually find themselves physically addicted. Their health deteriorates. As their self-confidence and judgment atrophy, they are less and less able to solve their original workload problem. … stress builds, which leads to more alcohol, which relieves stress, which leads to less perceived need to adjust workload, which leads to more workload, which leads to more stress. These are the general dynamics of addiction. In fact, almost all forms of addiction have shifting the burden structures underlying them. All involve opting for symptomatic solutions, the gradual atrophy of the ability to focus on fundamental solutions, and the increasing reliance on symptomatic solutions…. The longer the deterioration goes unnoticed, or the longer people wait to confront the fundamental causes, the more difficult it can be to reserve the situation." (108-109)

learn to identify the difference between fundamental solutions and symptomatic solutions. 112

"Because we don't see the structures underlying our actions, we focus on symptoms where the stress is greatest." 113

Look for common structures that underlyie and explain the problems you're seeing. 116. Frequently, people misattribute the causes for a company's failure to the wrong reasons.

The delay between cause and effect makes it hard to identify the fundamental problem. 119

quality degrades b/c the company underinvests in what matters to customers. groth slows & mgmt doubles down on sales instead of investing in quality. the downward cycle continues. 123

develop an ability to look past the noise (extraneous info) and see the systematic causes of an issue. see the forest insteda of the trees. 124

## Personal mastery
orgs are more effective with people who grow and develop out of a sense of personal mastery. 134

"When people genuinely care, they are naturally committed." 138

"[personal mastery] is a process of continually focusing and refocusing on what one truly wants, on one's visions." 139

creative tension -- striving toward your vision despite the many constraints and obstacles imposed by reality. 144

"Where then is the leverage in dealing with structural conflict? If structural conflict arises from deep underlying beliefs, then it can be changed only by changin the beliefs... beliefs change gradually as we accumulate new experiences--as we develop our personal mastery." 149 what are your underlying beliefs that might be the real source of the problem. address the fundamental problems. key warning signal is when we start blaming others. 149

"In my life, for example, for many years my epxeirence was that people let me down at critical unctures in major projects. When this happened, I would bulldoze through, overcoming the obstacle of their disloyalty or incompetence. It took many years before I recognized this as a recurring pattern, my own special form of the willpower strategy, rooted in a deep feeling of being powerless to change the way others let me down. Invariabily, I ended up feeling 'I've got to do it all myself.'"  149

Learn to see past the surface level reasons and find the truth that is driving the heart of the conflcit. 150
