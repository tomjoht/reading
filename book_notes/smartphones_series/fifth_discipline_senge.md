"Nature loves a balance--but many times, human decision makers act contrary to these balances, and pay the price." talks about mgrs who cut staff to reduce expenses only to find they pay contractors more because the same amount of work is expected to get done, or spend more in overtime pay. "*the system has its own agenda*. There is an implicit goal, unspoken but very real--the amount of work that is expected to get done." 84

"Balancing feedback processes are everywhere. They underlie all goal-oriented behavior. Complex organisms such as the human body contain thousands of balancing feedback processes that maintain temperature and balance, heal our wounds, adjust our eyesight to the amount of light, and alert us to thread. A biologist would say that all of these processes are the mechanisms by which our body achieves *homeostasis*--its ability to maintain conditions for survival in a changing environment." 84


"... certain patterns of structure recur again and again. These 'systems archetypes' or 'generic structures' embody the key to learning to see structures in our personal and organizational lives." 93

Archetype 1: Limits to Growth: "A reinforcing (amplifying) process is set in motion to produce a desired result. It creates a spiral of success but also creates inadvertent secondary effects (manifested in a balancing process) which eventually slow down the success." 94

"In each case of limits to growth, there is a reinforcing (amplifying) process of growth or improvement that operates on its own for a period of time. Then it runs up against a balancing (or stabilizing process, which operates to limit the growth. When that happens, the rate of improvement slows down, or even comes to a standstill." 96

"When the rate of improvement slows down, you want to compensate by striving even harder. Unfortunately, the more vigorously you push the familiar levers, the more strongly the balancing process resists, and the more futile your efforts become." 100 Some start to lower their goal.

"But there is another way to deal with limits to growth situations. *In each of them, leverage lies in the balancing loop--not the reinforcing loop. To change the behavior of the system, you must identify and change the limiting factor.*  This may require actions you may not yet have considered, choices you never noticed, or difficult changes in rewards and norms." 100

"Is there a situation in which things get better and better at first, and then mysteriously stop improving? once you have such a situation in mind, see if you can identify the appropriate elements of the reinforcing and balancing loops." 101 the reinforcing action is what led to improvement, the balancing loop is what countered that improvement.

"Once you've mapped out your situation, look for the leverage. It won't involve pushing harder; that will just make the resistance stronger. More likely, it will require weakening or removing the limiting condition." 102

talks about cycle of addiction. people start drinking as a way to cope with some failure, and it sort of makes them feel good / escape, but then drinking creates its own problems. 104, 108
