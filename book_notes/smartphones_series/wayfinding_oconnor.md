## questions the author has
"What happens when we outsource [[navigation]] to a gadget?" 5
what exactly is it that humans are doing when we navigate? how and why do we do it differently from birds, bees, and whales? HOw has the speed and convenience of technology changed how we move through the world and how we see our place in it?  6
what if Gps is a gadget that addresses a specific set of cultural conditions: a severance of the individual from direct experience and generational knowledge of a place? 14

what is [[wayfinding]]? "the use and organization of sensory information from the environment to guide us." 16 "quoting reginald golledge, " the ability to determine a route, learn it, and retrace or reverse it from memory through the acquisition of environmental knowledge." 16


## what is the author's main argument

wayfinding much more about simply having a mental cartesian map in the head. wayfinding is a skill that arises from an ability to "feel the land" as well as from cultural and experiential knowledge of the land. Wayfinding taps into the spatial centers of our brain, the hippocampus, and is closely connected with memory. there's not a single theory about how wayfinding occurs in the brain, but metaphors like the hippocampus as GPS or having a map in your head don't reflect what's going on. Wayfinding is more like following music (a cadence that is rooted by various markers in time). The close observation of the land and how we derive inferences and conclusions in a Sherlockian holmes way, constructing stories about what happened (animal tracking, usually) in the past and what will happen in the future logic to read nuances in the environment. GPS removes decision-making and spatial exercise from our brain, atrophying this part of our humanity. This atrophy could go beyond just getting lost more frequently but also spill into areas of cognitive decline, including loss of memory, identity, and imagination. Wayfinding is closely connected to core attributes that make us human, so neglecting wayfinding reduces our humanity.

"What is navigation really? Insights into time cells, social space, and music highlight how complex human navigation in the brain is: not just a calculation based on reading a Cartesian map but an unfolding memory or narrative sequence, human relationships, sensory experiences, personal history, or paths into the future." 177

"Maybe the metaphor at the heart of navigation is not following a map but listening and intuiting the progress of a piece of music." 179


Julian Stanley, "Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth." "What they found was that the two data points were strongly correlated, so much so that David Lubinski, a director of the study, told a reporter, 'I think [spatial ability] may be the largest unknown, untapped source of human potential.' Raw intelligence, it seems, is intertwined with our brain's spatial cognition aptitude."  261-62

cognitive issues arising from shrinking hippocampus. says modern tech makes us use our [[hippocampus]] less frequently. 262

"A cognitive [[map]] ... doesn't guide us in an ongoing manner. We can produce a map to try and get our orientation, but it's not the foundation of wayfinding." 179 we are not following a map in our heads when we navigate. it's more like following a melody.


## How does the author support her argument?

lots of research. this is a specialty in neuroscience, anthropology. interviews with experts. close interactions with three cultures: Inuit, Aborigee Austrailians, and Oceania.



## Wayfinding requires you to be present in the world


"...wayfinding is an activity that confronts us with the marvelous fact of being in the world, requiring us to look up and take notice, to cognitively and emotionally  interact with our surroundings whether we are in the wilderness or a city, even calling us to renew our species' love affair with freedom, exploration, and place." 10

Quoting an Inuit: "Being out on the land lifts you up spiritually, emotionally, and physically. It gives you medication, or meditation, however you want to call it." 36

gps severs us from direct experience. gps doesn't require us to remember.

wayfinding is about experiencing the land. 

the faster you travel, the less observant you become. "Quoting John MacDonald, , Inuit researcher. "The faster you traverse the land, the less observant of it you become." 78

comparing hippocampus to [[GPS]] is a false metaphor 180

navigation more about connecting vistas, "traveling along a particular route so as to generate or re-create the temporally structured flow of information that uniquely specifies that path to the destination." 181

Wayfinding people are much more observant of the landscape. 192

"In a [[car]] when you travel, you miss a lot of country, a lot of stories." 193 quoting Harney. aboriginee native.

mental map theory" "successful navigation relies on building abstract cognitive representations of the spatial relations between objects in the mind." 207

practical mastery theory: "successful navigation is a matter of memorizing the perspective of moving along a route." 207

"If you're paying attention and listen, often there is a whole other story, telling us where we are." 245quoting someone from Oceania talking about kayaking or something. 245

the car and pace of travel removes us from more immersion with the land that would lead to wayfinding. this is the key to wayfinding -- closer immersion in the world, awareness of your surroundings. 225

quoting Bohbot, The Hippocamus as a Cognitive Map. "Once you have learned the relationship between landmarks, you can derive a novel route to any destination from any starting position in the environment. Spatial memory is allocentric, it's independent of your starting position. You use spatial memory when you can picture the environment in your mind's eye." 263

"... exploring otherness and learning from newcomers about the land beyond the horizon is essential to nomadism." 251

car speed makes navigation harder because they aren't as observant of all the details. 160

getting lost is a desired experience. 290 

children have strong bonds with [[places]]. 296. quoting Dardel, "Before any choice, there is this place which we have no chosen, where the very foundation of our earthly existence and human conditions establishes itself." L'Homme et la terre. 296

topophilia: "the sense of attachment and love for place." 296

"Across cultures, navigation is influenced by particular environmental conditions -- snow, sand, water, wind -- and topographies -- mountain, valley, river, ocean, and dsert. But in all of them, it is also a means by which individuals develop a sense of attachment and feeling for places. Navigating becomes a way of knowing, familiarity, and fondness. It is how you can fall in love with a mountain or a forest. Wayfinding is how we accumulate treasuremaps of exquisite memories." 297

"In each of these examples, the practice of observation, the education of attention, began early in life, a process of attuning perception to the environment, committing story and intergenerational knowledge to memory." 298

navigation "start[s] with practicing acute [[observation]] of the places you already live." 298

The author asks people for tips on learning navigation. "Again and again, I was surprised by how simple the answers were. "Learn to draw," said Rubin. "We don't know how to represent the world well enough. Actually paying attention to the environment, making empirical observations and organizing them into a system--do that." 298

Veronique Bohbot "recommends that people interested in cognitive health make changes to their daily routines by incorporating new behaviors into their life, like taking new streets and shortcuts, creating mental maps." 299

"In The Need for Roots, the French philosopher Simone Weil claimed that "to be rooted is perhaps the most important and least recognized need of the human soul." 302

"...I never felt I had a home to return to. Yet when I really considered the *idea* of home, .... I found that I did have a reference, and it was the small, scrappy chicken farm that I had loved so much and so briefly as a child." 304

"This place had given me my first ecstatic memories and shaped me like clay." 305


## Effects of GPS on hippocampus
our hippocampus atrophies and we can no longer solve spatial problems. 18

turn by turn directions impact the brain

students are disoriented as to their place in the world. 19


my epiphany: Maybe this explains why following Google Maps doesn't seem to teach us navigation. navigation isn't a mental map -- it's reading the world and being part of it. Our distance and separation from the world makes navigation all but impossible except by false metaphor of the mental map.

Huth teaches course on navigation at Harvard. Students reactions to the course, "This course isn't about navigation but about a mindful way of living and finding our way and ourselves." said another. "To truly understand our surroundings we must immerse ourselves in them," wrote a third. 225 "We get philosophical about it, how knowing where you are helps you know your place in the world... I find it comforting to be orienting myself. ... it forces them to be keenly sensitive to their surroundings. .... The more attuned they are, the more their consciousness seems to expand. In this respect the effect of learning navigation struck me as echoing the discovery of a religious worldview or a transformative life experience: it thins the barriers between ourselves and the world." 225. [various summaries of student' perspectives her]

"Aging people who practice using their spatial memory have a more active hippocampus, a larger hippocampus, and better cognitive health." 267


knowledge is no longer tied to direct experience. 223. Huth and the kayak lifechanging experience.


"...chronic stress, untreated depression, insomnia, and alcohol abuse can all shrink hippocampal volume." 265


"Using Google Maps on one's phone to figure out a route to get somewhere is not dissimilar from using a print map; following turn-by-turn directions to get somehere is an entirely different matter. In the spring of 2017, *Nature Communications* published the result of a study Spiers coauthored that tested twenty-four people using GPS to navigate London's Soho neighborhood. It clearly showed that using a GPS navigation system to get to one's destination essentially switches off distinct parts of the brain, including the hippocampus." 271

'"Our results fit with models in which the hippocampus stimulates journeys on future possible paths while the prefrontal cortext helps us to plan which ones will get to our destination." Spiers talking to reporter. "When we have technology telling us which way to go, however, these parts of the brain simply don't respond to the street network. In that sense our brain has switched off its interest in the streets around us." 272-73

Veronoique Bohbot does not use GPS. While she was careful to point out that no one has yet designed a study to test whether GPS use causes hippocampal atrophy, there is plenty of evidence that following turn-by-turn directions means we are simply not using a spatial strategy to wayfind. In fact, using a GPS is very much like using the response strategy that exercises the caudate nucleus at a cost to the hippocamus. And because of the remarkable plasticity of the brain, not activating and exercising the hippocampus leads to decreased gray matter. Scientists do know that turn-by-turn directions activate the caudate nucleus, and its response strategy bypasses the creation of cognitive maps." 272

 Bohbot talking: "My gut instinct is yes, if people stop using their brains and totally devote themselves to their handheld devices to find their way around the world, that could have a negative effective on getting around the spillover effects on other things like memory." 272

"The crucial difference between the two methods, the researchers argued, was decision-making -- GPS users were not engaged in making decisions." 273

"A couple of years later, researchers at Carleton University conducted a study of 103 individuals and found that using GPS had a number of nefarious consequences for drivers in regard to attention and engagement. Using it replaced direct perception and eliminated the need to gather, integrate, comprehend, and process information from the environment. It also rid drivers of the need for wayfinding, decision-making, and problem-solving." 273



"What good could possibly come from outsourcing cognitive processes that were an essential aspect of making humans human?" 276

LIke the invention of the wheel, car, train, and airplane before us, technologies like the Hyperloop and fugure commercial space ventures will realign whole economies and patterns of movement. They may also realign the human mind." 278 author says how we distort our sense of time and space, shrinking it. 

"Time--saving it, managing it, maximizing it, escaping it, denying it --strikes me as one of the prime concerns and anxieties of modern life, and hence a metric by which we judge the quality of our travel. How fast is it, how easy to distract ourselves from the means and act of it, the burning of fuel, the people and places we fly over? 'We're not selling transportation, we're selling time,' promises Hyperloop."279-80

"Of course, navigational devices like maps, compasses, and sextants also fit Borgmann's device paradigm, because they outsource to some degree the formidable experience, observation, and memory needed to undertake skilled navigation. But even these inventions required a level of environmental awareness and orientation, as well as an understanding of topiography of celestial phenomena. It wasn't until the twentieth century that navigational technology released us from needing to pay *any* attention at all." 283

"But I see potential for a nefarious influence on our lives: the more we rely on driverless cars and their need for three-dimensional maps, the narrower our choices of where we travel and explore could become. As we grow to depend upon, or maybe even just prefer, autonomous vehicles, they will choose the routes we take, and they in turn will choose those routes that are already mapped. Where we go will increasingly be confined by the technology we use." 283-84

The allure of autonomous vehicle sis that so much of our travel along monotonous highways slashed across the landscape, often bordered by sound-insulating walls so as to limit one's view, already feels like a waste of time. If our brains are on autopilot while driving, responding to GPS_simulated instructions, wouldn't it be better to spend that time in some other way? ... I see the driverless car as representing yet another severance between our movement through space and time and the pleasure of effort and autonomy. GPS relieves us of the need to form cognitive maps, and driverless cars relieve us of the need to look away from our screens and take note of directly experienced phenomena in the environment. In seeking maximum speed and ultimate efficiency, the autonomous vehicle cocoons us from the physics of movement at high speeds and the burning of fuel. Rather than plunge us into relaity, an autonomous vehicle era  285-86

"The driver quite literally relies on the virtual representation of the road rather than their unmediated perception of the physical road. " 273

Harry Heft, professor of environmental psychology. "The GPS diffuses that whole way of engaging the world ... because you don't even really have to *look* at the world very much." 273

GPS doesn't require you to be observant/aware of your environment. 

"The highway system is so disconnected form the terrain and the topology. I think what GPS does is lead you even further away from that." 274

"Busy, rushed Americans, he [John Stilgoe, landscape historian] thinks so, no longer take the time to explore and discover their surroundings and have lost their capacity to even see them directly. Stilgoee believes that in an age dominated by programmed, medicated material and the internet, the ability to *look* at things, to practice the art of observation that was required of us as a species for eons till now is an essential aspect of our intellect and has to be relearned."  290

"... for someone who prizes exploration as a primary exercise that allows the mind to wander, there could be no more unique capacities in return for  mere effiency. To him, getting lost is an opportunity for discovery, one that demands that all the senses come alive, and creates a maximum alertness in which observation and possibility are heightened. In *What Is Landscape? Stilgoe writes that '[b]eing lost, even being deliberately free of electronic location devices, sharpens one's senses and often eventually reassures." 290

"If I'm lost and I don't have anyone to ask, I love that feeling," he [Joe Stilgo] said, though he drew a distinction between being desperately lost in dangerous circumstances and getting lost in a generally unknown place. In the latter case, to go off track is really about challenging the borders of one's familiarity, pressing beyond the known spaces of our understanding and experiences and into the new." 291-292 

"Part of the problem is parents' incessant management of their children's time. "I think they've missed a kind of self-guided, nonorganized activity, nonsports activity growing up. Wandering around, getting into things. .... most of my colleagues I work with seem to have found their careers by being slightly disorganized. Lucking into something, you know?" Joe Stilgoe. 292-93

children can no longer roam or wander about due to the city roadscape. 292

quoting a study: "Autonomy is a key to the acquisition of spatial skills, therefore the development of these skills can be hindered if children cannot move independently in the outdoor environment." 294

"For Stilgoe, the ubiquity of smartphones can never be a good thing. His career has been dedicated to creating thirst in his students for curiousity, exploration, and wonder ---- believing them to be in fact the keystones of true intellect. Smartphones don't open the user up to their surroundings, they funnel attention inot themselves and a universe where everything is known, mapped, and accessible." 294

## Wayfinding arises from a cultural/historical connection with the land


"By associating stories with specific places and encoding navigation information within the sequences of songs or stories, they made it easier to recall them through reciting these oral maps. This strategy is not unlike the Greek memory palaces, except Aboriginal people treated the *landscape* as a memory palace rather than inventing imaginary ones." 139


"totemic geography" "gives 'deeper significant to ordinary geography and makes it more memorable.'" 143 quoting Luise Hercus, anthropologist. 


with aboriginee dreamtreeacks, stories are embedded in places -- and that takes root in memory. 144

Dreaming track: "the network of Aboriginal trade routes and cultural thuways that crisscrosses the whole of the continent like a noosphereic highway system." 135

geographical knowledge is linked with family history and ancestry. 158


"Oftentimes landscape categories were combined with an individual's knowledge of botany, topography, intergroup relations, and individual life history and memory; all came into play as they traveled." 208-209

unrelated: connection to land is what defines us as people. whee are you from? is the first question we ask. it establishes context, identity, a sense of home, belonging to a place, grounds our identity.


navigation is about much more than just assessing what you see with the mental map in your head. 208

According to Tim Ingol, anthropology professor, "wayfinding is 'a skilled performance in which the traveler, whose powers of perception and action have been fine-tuned through previous experience, 'feels his way' towards his goal, continually adjusting his movements in response to an ongoing perceptual monitoring of his surroundings.'" 211 

"Gibson's ideas meant that perception is not the result of a mind in a body but of an organism as a whole in its environment, and is 'tantamount to the organism's own exploratory movement through the world.'... We are not self-continued individuals confronting a world *out there*, but developing organisms in an environment, enmeshed in tangled relationships. As we move through space, our knowledge undergoes continuous formulation; wayfinding isn't knowing *before* we go, but as he [Ingold] put it, 'knowing as we go.'" 212


"For Ingold the notion that aspects of the structure of the world are copied onto an analogous structure in the mind in the form of a map, which is then constantly updated, is nonsensical. It not only fails to capture the dynamic complexity and the skills involved in finding one's way through a landscape ... but it also falls short because maps themselves are a cultural invention. Indeed, the great myth of cartography is that maps are independent of any point of view and equally valid wherever one stands when, in fact, they always take a point of view, prioritize information, choose a scale. In contrast, Ingold argues that extending the map metaphor into the domain of cognition ignores the wisdom and practical sensibility of the navigator, divorcing tradition from locality, culture from place, and traditional knowledge from the environmentally situated experience of practitioners. In is, in other words, not how most humans actually experience the world. 212-213. 


some cultures use an "absolute frame of reference [east, west, etc.] rather than an egocentric perspective." 206
tom: how do you develop a sense of place and love of the land when you live in the geography of nowhere? 

creation, ancestral stories describe the birth of the land -- so wayfinding naturally is part of the culture, history, and religion. 196

tom: i miss a closer connection to the land. our memories are deeply rooted in the context of places. 


## Wayfinding requires logical inferences and thinking

- wayfinding is not too unlike how a programmer might feel his or her way through a problem. looking at error messages, simplifying the problem to isolate the error, and generally piecing together the solution. the wayfinder in a natural environment does this to suss out environment cues. so it's not like we've become Walle-like potatoes. we just focus in other areas.

hippocampus allowed us to make evolutionary leap. correlation between Sherlock Holmes, Freud, and early hunters. inductive/deductive logic and evidentiary reasoning derive from hunting. 101

narrative originates from hunting. "the hunter is able to produce a narrative sequence... the idea of narration might have originated in a hunting society." 102

"Our existence depends on thousands of instances of inference and deducation that allow us to draw conclusions about other people and things, what has happened and what will happen." 103 

this is called the social trackways theory. "hominids are animals that learned to 'read' the tracks of other hominies and aniamls and eventually infer meaning about events that happened in the past from these symbols. This enabled them to predict future behaviors based on these stories and use them to find one another, avoid predators, and successfully hunt prey" 105

"The sequence of cognitive development also describes the birth of autonoetic consciousness, the capacity to be aware of one's own existence as an entity in time." 105. autonoetic comes from Greek "perceptive"

place and memory and stories are all intricately linked with the development of the human mind. 121

storytelling is the center piece of human intelligence. 122-23

language develops as a tool for thought, not just communication. 123 language enables thought (but not entirely) 130

reading: *The Hippocampus as a Cognitive Map*

"An organism experiences space in relationship to itself (egocentric), but the brain is also capable of what they called 'nonegocentric cognition,' or allocentric perspective, an ability to objectively represent the environment in three-dimensional space. This is the cognitive map in the hippocampus." 168

interpreting signs was the first science. 218 Liebenberg, Harvard professor, says "[trackers] have to create a working hypothesis in which spoor evidence is supplemented with hypothetical assumptions based not only on their knowledge of animal behavior, but also on their creative ability to solve new problems and discover new information." 218

Liebenberg argues that "rational scientific thinking didn't originate with the ancient Greeks but with hunter-gatherers" 219

caudate nucleus is "a structure that builds habits." "autopilot takes over. you see the white building, it acts as a stimulus and triggers a response to turn left to get to the bakery." 263

"Even though the caudate nucleus uses repetition to navigate successfully, it's actually *not* a spatial strategy." 264 caudate nucleus forms habit triggered by visual landmarks.

you use spatial part of your brain when you're wayfinding, but then when it becomes habit, automatic,  your caudate nucleus takes over and the hippocampus is no longer involved. this is why you should frequently change your route. 264

"The researchers found a high probability that people who used a spatial strategy had more gray matter density in the hippocampus, and the inverse was also true: those who used a response strategy had more gray matter n the caudate nucleus." 265


Recommendations: "Take new streets and shortcuts to get places; regularly draw a bird's-eye view of your environment with landmarks; incorporate new behaviors and routes into your daily life. The benefits of hippocampal health appear to be far-reaching. 'There's some studies that show people who have a larger hippocampus have more sense of control over their lives...." 268

constantly change your routes to avoid automation. Exercise your hippocampus. 268

hippocampus also plays a role in imagination. "We use the neural circuit not only to reconstruct the where and when of the past but also to build images of the future; it is the locus of our imagination." 274 ... "Our brains are like prediction machines, generating episodes that might occur in the near or distant future and using them to plan, problem-solve, and achieve goals. In this way the human imagination is like a beacon that orients us, helping us to make decisions about where we want to go and how we might get there..." 274 author speculates that loss of imagination might make us numb to detrimental directions we're heading with climate change, unable to fully imagine the consequences of our current path we're heading.

## Economic realities of wayfinding as a needed skill

- the reality is that there's not much of an economic place for wayfinding. the person who can solve computer problems makes a much better use of his or her mind than the person who can wayfind without a map. the reality is that all the groups Connor profiles are on the decline, their expertise on the verge of extinction. wayfinding is becoming a lost skill that is on its way out.


modern society doesn't support a voyager role. "Few people, it seems, have found a way to survive and support a family voyaging canoes in the modern world."  246 


## Hippocampus and episodic memory


loci method with the memory palace. 50
"The mnemonist creates a vivid mental place, akin to the brain's spatial representation of an actual place, and navigates it during the quest for a specific memory. The method of loic takes a piece of abstract, disembodied information and gives it  spatial organiztion that transforms it into a memory supported by the hippocampus." 52

London cabbies and The Knowledge. 52


navigation relies heavily on a heitened memory. memory and navigation go hand in hand. 55

 "At the core of her [Kate Jeffry, neuroscientist] interest is the mystery of why the human brain seems to use the same neural circuit for navigating space and episodic memory; she has called it one of the most outstanding questions about the brain. 'Why would nature have used the same structures for both space and memory, which seem so very different?...An intriguing possibility is tha tthe cognitive map provides, in a manner of speaking, the stage upon which the drama of recollected life events is played out." 58

if the hippocampus doesn't function correctly, neither does memory. 65

"...the capacity to store iformation about environments for spatial exploration and place-learning allows the encoding of events and where they occur, increasing memory capacity." 66

as children begin to move about their environment, it sets up the infrastructure of longer memory." 69

migratory birds have larger hippocampuses 73

memory and navigatoin are intricately linked

"...oral epics are almost always spatial because this makes it easier for the human mind to remember them." 144


hippocampus also involved in memory. 169

"Their theory predicted that the hippocampus was the core of a neural system that provided a spatial framework for storing memories of what happened in a particular place, not facts but events. The idea was that episodes were built upon the basic spatial framework through the addition of a linear senes of time amongst other higher-order cognitive capacities." 170

..."the hippocampus was indeed a critical part of the brain for both cognitive mapping and episodic memory." 170

forming memories, stories of life experiences, takes place int he hippocampus. 172

The hippocampus is "organizing and integrating all these bits and piece sof information in a contextual framework," quoting Howard Eichenbaum, neuroscientist

brain cells fire based on place. 162

navigation isn't about cartesian maps but about memory space. 174

the hippocampus creates maps that involve space and time. 176

"Ingold has described wayfinding as an act of remembering similar to how one remembers a piece of music. Just as with musical performance, wayfinding has an essentially temporal character: 'the path, like the musical melody, unfolds over time rather than across space.' It struck me as not so different from Howard Eichenbaum's description of navigation as hippocampal networks that encode 'journeys through space as memory episodes defined by sequences of events and the locations where they occur.'" 213

"Individuals with Alzheimer's undergo a painful process of losing both memory and identity. But one of the first symptoms is that they often lose their way, misplace things, and forget where they are and how they go there." 267

researchers "use space to get to memory.... I came into the field through memory but then space seemed to become more rich. I've always loved maps and how we actually find our way. It's got this fascinating philosophycal element as well. What is space? What is a place." quoting Spiers, researcher. "...space is something that you can pin things on because it's stable.... Space is like a scaffold for adding your memories onto a map." 271

rats with their hippocampus damaged can't remember place learning. 169
