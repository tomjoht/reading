Flow, by Mihay Csikszentmihalyi


"The best moments usually occur when a person's body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficult and worthwhile." 3

"*flow*--the state in which people are so involved in an activity that nothing else seems to matter; the experience itself is so enjoyable that people will do it even at great cost, for the sheer sake of doing it." 4

"The optimal state of inner experience is one in which there is *ordered in consciousness*. This happens when psychic energy -- or attention -- is invested in realistic goals, and when skills match the opportunities for action." 6

"This simple truth -- that the control of consciousness determines the quality of life -- has been known for a long time; in fact, for as long as human records exist." 20

"Like other complex forms of expertise, such as a mature political judgment or a refined aesthetic sense, it must be earned through trial-and-error experience by each individual, generation after generation. Control over consciousness is not simply a cognitive skill. At least as much as intelligence, it requires the commitment of emotions and will. It is not enough to *know* how to do it; one must *do* it, consistently, in the same way as athletes or musicians who must keep practicing what they know in theory."21

"... what, then, does it mean to be conscious? it simply means that certain specific *conscious events* (sensations, feelings, thoughts, intentions) are occurring, and that we are able to direct their course." 26

"It is attention that selects relevant bits of information from the potential millions of bits available." 31

"The mark of a person who is in control of consciousness is the ability to focus attention at will, to be oblivious to distractions, to concentrate for as long as it takes to achieve a goal, and not longer. And the person who can do this usually enjoys the normal course of everyday life." 31

"Each person allocates his or her limited attention either by focusing it intentionally like a beam of energy... or by diffusing it in desultory, random movements." 33

"Whenever information disrupts consciousness by threatening its goals we have a condition of inner disorder, or *psychic entropy* a disorganization of the self that impairs its effectiveness." 37

during states of flow, "there is no disorder to straighten out" 41

"We have called this state the *flow experience* because this is the term many of the people we interviewed had used in their descriptions of how it felt to be in top form: 'It was like floating," "I was carried on by the flow.' It is the opposite of psychic entropy-- in fact, it is sometimes called negentropy..." 40

"The 'battle' is not really *against* the self, but against the entropy that brings disorder to consciousness. It is really a battle *for* the self; it is a struggle for establishing control over attention." Winning this battle "requires an equal degree of disciplined concentration." 40-41

Flow helps to integrate the self because in that state of deep concentration consciousness is usually well ordered. Thoughts, intentions, feelings, and all the senses are focused on the same goal. Experience is in harmony." 41

"When we choose a goal and invest ourselves in it to the limits of our concentration, whatever we do will be enjoyable." 42

"Changing external conditions might seem to work at first, but if a person is not in control of his consciousness, the old fears or desires will soon return, reviving previous anxieties. One cannot create a complete sense of inner security even by buying one's own Caribbean island and surrounding it with armed bodyguards and attack dogs." 43

in his study, he asked people to describe how they felt at various points throughout the day. they found that they feel best during these moments. "First, the experience usually occurs when we confront tasks we have a chance of completing. Second, we must be able t o concentrate on what we are doing. Third and fourth, the concentration is usually possible because the task undertaken has clear goals and provides immediate feedback. Fifth, one acts with a deep but effortless involvement that removes from awareness the worries and frustrations of everyday life.  Sixth, enjoyable experiences allow people to exercise a sense of control over their actions. Seventh, concern for the self disappears, yet paradoxically the sense of self emerges stronger after the flow experience is over. Finally, the sense of the duration of time is altered; hours pass by in minutes, and minutes can stretch out to seem like hours. The combination of all these elements causes a sense of deep enjoyment that is so rewarding people feel that expanding a great deal of energy is worthwhile simply to be able to feel it."  49

"...by far the overwhelming proportion of optimal experiences are reported to occur within sequences of activities that are goal-directed and bounded by rules--activities that require the investment of psychic energy, and that could not be done without the appropriate skills. 49

"...how enjoyable an activity is depends ultimately on its complexity." 52

"Enjoyment appears at the boundary between boredom and anxiety, when the challenges are just balanced with the person's capacity to act." 52

"When all a person's relevant skills are needed to cope with the challenges of a situation, that person's attention is completely absorbed by the activity." 53

"Although the flow experience appears to be effortless, it is far from being so. It often requires strenuous physical exertion, or highly disciplined mental activity. It does not happen without the application of skilled performance. Any laps in concentration will erase it." 54

"... receiving clear feedback [is] a condition for enjoying whatever they were doing." 58

"In normal everyday existence, we are the prey of thoughts and worries intruding unwanted in consciousness. Because most jobs, and home life in general, lack the pressing demands of flow experiences, concentration is rarely so intense that preoccupations and anxieties can be automatically ruled out. Consequently the ordinary state of mind involves unexpected and frequent episodes of entropy interfering with the smooth run of psychic energy. This is one reason why flow improves the quality of experience: the clearly structured demands of the activity impose order, and exclude the interference of disorder in consciousness." 58

"...only a very select range of information can be allowed into awareness. Therefore all the troubling thoughts that ordinarily keep passing through the mind are temporarily kept in abeyance." 58

"The concentration of the flow experience -- together with clear goals and immediate feedback -- provides order to consciousness, inducing the enjoyable condition of psychic negentropy." 59

"One of the most common descriptions of optimal experience [flow] is that time no longer seems to pass the way it ordinarily does." 66

"autotelic": "It refers to a self-contained activity, one that is done not with the expectation of some future benefit, but simply because the doing itself is the reward." 67

"When experience is intrinsically rewarding life is justified in the present, instead of being held hostage to a hypothetical future gain." 69

"We have seen how people describe the common characteristics of optimal experience: a sense that one's skills are adequate to cope with the challenges at hand, in a goal-directed, rule-bound action system that provides clear clues as to how well one is performing. Concentration is so intense that there is no attention left over to think about anything irrelevant, or to worry about problems. Self-consciousness disappears, and the sense of time becomes distorted. An activity that produces such experiences is so gratifying that people are willing to do it for its own sake, with little concern for what they will get out of it, even when it is difficult, or dangerous." 71

"To many people activities like working or raising children provide more flow than playing a game or painting a picture because these individuals have learned to perceive opportunities in such mundane tasks that others do not see." 76

"Some people enjoy themselves wherever they are, while others stay bored even when confronted with the most dazzling prospects." 83

"While paying attention ordinarily involves an additional burden of information processing above the usual baseline effort, for people who have learned to control consciousness focusing attention is relatively effortless, because they can shut off all mental processes but the relevant ones." 87-88

"The association between the ability to concentrate and flow is clear; it will take further research to ascertain which one causes the other." 88

"The traits that mark an autotelic personality [one who enjoys the activity for itself] are most clearly revealed by people who seem to enjoy situations that ordinary persons would find unbearable.... First, they paid close attention to the most minute details of their environment, discovering in it hidden opportunities for action that matched what little they were capable of doing, given the circumstances." 90

"The similarities between Yoga and flow are extremely strong; in fact it makes sense to think of Yoga as a very thoroughly planned flow activity. Both try to achieve a joyous, self-forgetful involvement through concentration, which in turn is made possible by a discipline of the body. 105

"To transform the biological necessity of feeding into a flow experience, one must begin by paying attention to what one eats. It is astonishing -- as well as discouraging -- when guests swallow lovingly prepared food without any sign of having noticed its virtues." 114

"...there have to be rules, a goal, and a way of obtaining feedback." 118


"Contrary to what we tend to assume, the normal state of the mind is chaos. Without training, and without an object in the external world that demands attention, people are unable to focus their thoughts for more than a few minutes at a time. It is relatively easy to concentrate when attention is structured by outside stimuli, such as when a movie is playing on the screen, or when while driving heavy traffic is encountered on the road. If one is reading an exciting book, the same thing occurs, but most readers still begin to lose concentration after a few pages, and their minds wander away from the plot. At that point, if they wish to continue reading, they must make an effort to force their attention back to the page." 119

"But when we are left alone, with no demands on attention, the basic disorder of the mind reveals itself. With nothing to do, it begins to follow random patterns, usually stopping to consider something painful or disturbing. Unless a person knows how to give order to his or her thoughts, attention will be attracted to whatever is most problematic at the moment: it will focus on some real or imaginary pain, on recent grudges or long-term frustrations. Entropy is the normal state of consciousness--a condition that is neither useful nor enjoyable.

"To avoid this condition, people are naturally eager to fill their minds with whatever information is readily available, as long as it distracts attention from turning inward and dwelling on negative feelings. This explains why such a huge proportion of time is invested in watching television, despite the fact that it is very rarely enjoyed. Compared to other sources of stimulation -- like reading, talking to other people, or working on a hobby -- TV can provide continuous and easily accessible information that will structure the viewer's attention, at a very low cost in terms of the psychic energy that needs to be invested. While people watch television, they need not fear that their drifting minds will force them to face disturbing personal problems. It is understandable that, once one develops this strategy for overcoming psychic entropy, to give up the habit becomes almost impossible.

The better route for avoiding chaos in consciousness, of course, is through habits that give control over mental processes to the individual, rather than to some external source of stimulation, such as the programs of network TV." 119-20

"Great thinkers have always been motivated by the enjoyment of thinking rather than by the material rewards that could be gained by it... Democritus [who would sit for days "immersed in thought"] "was not losing his mind; he was lost in the flow of thought." 126

"The point is that playing with ideas is extremely exhilarating. Not only philosophy but the emergence of new scientific ideas is fueled by the enjoyment one obtains from creating a new way to describe reality. The tools that make the flow of thought possible are common property, and consist of the knowledge recorded in books available in schools and libraries. A person who becomes familiar with the conventions of poetry, or the rules of calculus, can subsequently grow independent of external stimulation. She can generate ordered trains of thought regardless of what is happening in external reality. When a person has learned a symbolic system well enough to use it, she has established a portable, self-contained world within the mind." 127

"... having a portal set of rules that the mind can work with is of great benefit even in a normal life. People without an internalized symbolic system can all too easily become captives of the media. They are easily manipulated.... If we have become dependent on television...., it is because we have so little to fall back on, it is because we have so little to fall back on, so few internal rules to keep our mind from being taken over by those who claim to have the answers. Without the capacity to provide its own information, the mind drifts into randomness. It is within each person's power to decide whether its order will be restored from the outside, in ways over which we have no control, or whether the order will be the result of an internal pattern that grows organically from our skills and knowledge." 128

"In today's world we have come to neglect the habit of writing because so many other media of communication have taken its place. Telephones and tape recorders, computers and fax machines are more efficient in conveying news. If the only point to writing were to *transmit* information, then it would deserve to become obsolete. But the point of writing is to *create* information, not simply to pass it along. In the past, educated persons used journals and personal correspondence to put their experiences into words, which allowed them to reflect on what had happened during the day. The prodigiously detailed letters so many Victorians wrote are an example of how people created patterns of order out of the mainly random events impinging on their consciousness. The kind of material we write in diaries and letters does not exist before it is written down. It is the slow, organically growing process of thought involved in writing that lets the ideas emerge in the first place." 131

"Many have commented lately about the fact that poets and playwrights as a group show unusually severe symptoms of depression and other affective disorders. Perhaps one reason they become full-time writers is that their consciousness is beset by entropy to an unusual degree; writing becomes a therapy for shaping some order among the confusion of feelings. It is possible that the only way writers can experience flow is by creating a world of words in which they can act with abandon, erasing from the mind the existence of a troubling reality." 132

summary: famous scientists when asked why they spent so much time doing what they did, respond that "It was so much fun." ..."They simply did what they enjoyed doing." 137

"The mental framework that makes science enjoyable is accessible to everyone. It involves curiosity, careful observation, a disciplines way of recording events, and finding ways to tease out the underlying regularities in what one learns. It also requires the humility to be willing to learn from the results of past investigators, coupled with enough skepticism and openness of mind to reject beliefs that are not supported by facts." 137

"As in all other branches of learning, the first step after deciding what area one wants to pursue is to learn what others have thought about the matter. By reading, talking, and listening selectively one can form an idea of what the 'state of the art' in the field is. Again, the importance of personally taking control of the direction of learning from the very first steps cannot be stressed enough. If a person feels coerced to read a certain book, to follow a given course because that is supposed to be the way to do it, learning will go against the grain. But if the decision is to take that same route because of an inner feeling of rightness, the learning will be relatively effortless and enjoyable." 139

"In philosophy as in other disciplines there comes a point where a person is ready to pass from the status of passive consumer to that of active producer. To write down one's insights expecting that someday they will be read with awe by posterity would be in most cases an act of hubris, that 'overweening presumption' that has caused so much mischief in human affairs. But if one records ideas in response to an inner challenge to express clearly the major questions by which one feels confronted, and tries to sketch out answers that will help make sense of one's experiences, then the amateur philosopher will have learned to derive enjoyment from one of the most difficult and rewarding tasks of life." 139

The point of becoming an amateur scientist is not to compete with professionals on their own turf, but to use a symbolic discipline to extend mental skills, and to create order in consciousness." 141

"The more a job inherently resembles a game -- with variety, appropriate and flexible challenges, clear goals, and immediate feedback -- the more enjoyable it will be regardless of the worker's level of development." 152

"The reason that working was so much fun is that it was continually challenging." 153

during surgery, "throughout the process one knows exactly how successful one is, and if not, why not. For this reason alone, most surgeons believe that what they are doing is so much more enjoyable than any other branch of medicine, or any other job on earth." 156


"Thus we have the paradoxical situation: On the job people feel skillful and challenged, and therefore feel more happy, strong, creative, and satisfied. In their free time people feel that there is generally not much to do and their skills are not being used, and therefore they tend to feel more sad, weak, dull, and dissatisfied. Yet they would like to work less and spend more time in leisure." 159

"Whether a job has variety or not ultimately depends more on a person's approach to it than on actual working conditions." 161

"Stress exists only if we experience it; it takes the most extreme objective conditions to cause it directly. The same amount of pressure will wilt one person and be a welcome challenge to another." 161

"Ironically jobs are actually easier to enjoy than free time, because like flow activities they have built-in goals, feedback, rules, and challenges, all of which encourage one to become involved in one's work, to concentrate and lose oneself in it. Free time, on the other hand, is unstructured, and requires much greater effort to be shaped into something that can be enjoyed. Hobbies that demand skill, habits that set goals and limits, personal interest, and especially inner discipline help to make leisure what it is supposed to be -- a chance for *re-creation*." 162

"Why is solitude such a negative experience? The bottom-line answer is that keeping order in the mind from within is very difficult. We need external goals, external stimulation, external feedback to keep attention directed. And when external input is lacking, attention begins to wander, and thoughts become chaotic -- resulting in the state we have called 'psychic entropy' in chapter 2. 168-69

TV: 
"Worries about one's love life, health, investments, family, and job are always hovering at the periphery of attention, waiting until there is nothing pressing that demands concentration. As soon as the mind is ready to relax, *zap!* the potential problems that were waiting in the wings take over. / It is for this reason that television provides such a boon to so many people. Although watching TV is far from being a positive experience -- generally people report feeling passive, weak, rather irritable, and sad when doing it -- at least the flickering screen brings a certain amount of order to consciousness. The predictable plots, familiar characters, and even the redundant commercials provide a reassuring pattern of stimulation. The screen invites attention to itself as a manageable, restricted aspect of the environment. While interacting with television, the mind is protected from personal worries. The information passing across the screen keeps unpleasant concerns out of the mind." 169

"A person who rarely gets bored, who does not constantly need a favorable external environment to enjoy the moment, has passed the test for having achieved a creative life." 171

"If a person does not know how to control attention in solitude, he will inevitably turn to the easy external solutions: drugs, entertainment, excitement -- whatever dulls or distracts the mind." 172

"When physical vigor fails with age, for example, it means that one will be ready to turn one's energy is from the mastery of the external world to a deep exploration of inner reality. It means that one can finally read Proust, take up chess, grow orchids, help one's neighbors, and think about God -- if these are the things one has decided are worth pursuing." 172

"One can survive solitude, but only if one finds ways of ordering attention that will prevent entropy from destructuring the mind." 174

"To provide flow, a family has to have a goal for its existence. ... Positive goals are necessary to focus the psychic energies of parents and children on common tasks.... In an integrated family, each person's goals matter to all others." 180

"More than anything else they involve paying attention to the partner's own complexity, getting to know her at deeper levels than were necessary in the earlier days of the relationships, supporting him with sympathy and compassion during the inevitable changes that the years bring." 182

"The same need to constantly increase challenges and skills applies to one's relationship with children. During the course of infancy and early childhood most parents spontaneously enjoy the unfolding of their babies' growth: the first smile, the first word, the first few steps, the first scribbles. Each of these quantum jumps in the child's skills becomes a new joyful challenge, to which parents respond by enriching the child's opportunities to act. From the cradle to the playpen to the playground to kindergarten, the parents keep adjusting the balance of challenges and skills between the child and her environment. But by early adolescence, many teenagers get to be too much to handle. What most parents do at that point is to politely ignore their children's lives, pretending that everything is all right, hoping against hope that it will be.... Because our present social arrangements,however, do not provide adequate challenges for the skills teenagers have, they must discover opportunities for action outside those sanctioned by adults. the only outlets they find, all too often, are vandalism, delinquency, drugs, and recreational sex... what can a strong, vital, intelligent fifteen-year-old do in your typical suburb? If you consider that question you will probably conclude that what is available is either too artificial, too simple, or not exciting enough to catch a teenager's imagination. It is not surprising that athletics are so important in suburban schools; compared to the alternatives, they provide some of the most concrete chances to exercise and display one's skills." 182-183"If parents just talked more about their ideals and dreams -- even if these had been frustrated -- the children might develop the ambition needed to break through the complacency of their present selves... But if the father spends all his free time at home vegetating in front of the TV set with a glass of alcohol in his hand, children will naturally assume that adults are boring people who don't know how to have fun, and will turn to the peer group for e enjoyment." 183

"Unconditional acceptance is especially important to children. If parents threaten to withdraw their love from a child when he fails to measure up, the child's natural playfulness will be gradually replaced by chronic anxiety. However, if the child feels that his parents are unconditionally committed to his welfare, he can then relax and explore the world without fear; otherwise he has to allocate psychic energy to his own protection, thereby reducing the amount he can freely dispose of Early emotional security may well be one of the conditions that helps develop an autotelic personality in children. Without this, it is difficult to let go of the self long enough to experience flow." 184

"One of the most basic delusions of our time is that home life takes care of itself naturally, and that the best strategy for dealing with it is to relax and let it take its course. Men especially like to comfort themselves with this notion. They know how hard it is to succeed on the job, how much effort they have to put into their careers. so at home they just want to unwind, and feel that any serious demand from the family is unwarranted. they often have an almost superstitious faith in the integrity of the home. Only when it is too late -- when the wife has become dependent on alcohol, when the children have turned into cold strangers -- do many men wake up to the fact that the family, like any other joint enterprise, needs constant investments of psychic energy to assure its existence." 185

"It is not surprising that in our studies of the quality of daily experience it has been demonstrated again and again that people report the most positive moods overall when they are with friends. This is not only true of teenagers: young adults are also happier with friends than with anyone else, including their spouses. Even retirees are happier when they are with friends than when they are with their spouses or families. / Because a friendship usually involves common goals and common activities, it is 'naturally' enjoyable." 186

"Expressive skills ... refer to actions that attempt to externalize our subjective experiences... When involved with an expressive activity we feel in touch with our real self." 188

"But no social change can come about until the consciousness of individuals is changed first." 191

"Of all the virtues we can learn no trait is more useful, more essential for survival, and more likely to improve the quality of life than the ability to transform adversity into an enjoyable challenge." 200

"Sooner or later everyone will have to confront events that contradict his goals: disappointments, severe illness, financial reversal, and eventually the inevitability of one's death. Each event of this kind is negative feedback that produces disorder in the mind. Each threatens the self and impairs its functioning." 202

"Why are some people weakened by stress, while others gain strength from it? Basically the answer is simple: those who know how to transform a hopeless situation into a new flow activity that can be controlled will be able to enjoy themselves, and emerge stronger from the ordeal." 203

"Achieving this unity with one's surroundings is not only an important component of enjoyable flow experiences but is also a central mechanism by which adversity is conquered. In the first place, when attention is focused away from the self, frustrations of one's desires have less of a chance to disrupt consciousness. To experience psychic entropy one must concentrate on the internal disorder; but by paying attention to what is happening around oneself instead, the destructive effects of stress are lessened. Second, the person whose attention is immersed in the environment becomes part of it -- she participates in the system by linking herself to it through psychical energy. This, in turn, makes it possible for her to understand the properties of the system, so that she can find a better way to adapt to a problematic situation." 205 [think to missionary experience and how you became so engrossed in others and the environment around you all day. that led to some of the most transformative experiences of your life.]

"Almost every situation we encounter in life presents possibilities for growth. As we have seen, even terrible disasters like blindness and paraplegia can be turned into conditions for enjoyment and greater complexity. Even the approach of death itself can serve to create harmony in consciousness, rather than despair." 207

..."pay attention to what is happening around us..." 208

"The autotelic self transforms potentially entropic experience into flow." 209


The Autotelic self
1. Setting goals. "To be able to experience flow, one must have clear goals to strive for." 209
2. Becoming immersed in the activity. "After choosing a system of action, a person with an autotelic personality grows deeply involved with whatever he is doing.... he invests attention in the task at hand." 210 "

"involvement is greater facilitated by the ability to concentrate." 211

3. *Paying attention to what is happening*. "Concentration leads to involvement, which can only be maintained by constant inputs of attention." 211

4. Learning to enjoy immediate experience.* "Being in control of the mind means that literally anything that happens can be a source of joy." 212-13

"People who find their lives meaningful usually have a goal that is challenging enough to take up all their energies, a goal that can give significance to their lives. We may refer to this process as achieving *purpose*. ... The goal in itself is usually not important; what matters is that it focuses a person's attention and involves it in an achievable, enjoyable activity." 216

"...a unified purpose is what gives meaning to life." 217

summary: The goal focuses your energy and effort -- hence the journey, not the destination, is important. 217

"What counts is not so much whether a person actually achieves what she has set out to do; rather, it matters whether effort has been expended to reach the goal, instead of being diffused or wasted." 217

"Goals justify the effort they demand at the outset, but later it is the effort that justifies the goal." 224

"Activity and reflection should ideally complement and support each other. Action by itself is blind, reflection important." 226

"The original condition of human beings, prior to the development of self-reflective consciousness, must have been a state of inner peace disturbed only now and again by tides of hunger, sexuality, pain, and danger. The forms of psychic entropy that currently cause us so much anguish -- unfulfilled wants, dashed expectations, loneliness, frustration, anxiety, guilt -- are all likely to have been recent invaders of the mind. They are by-products of the tremendous increase in complexity of the cerebral cortex and of the symbolic enrichment to culture. They are the dark side of the emergence of consciousness." 227

"When a person's psychic energy coalesces into a life theme, consciousness achieves harmony." 230

"Ever since Freud, psychologists have been interested in explaining how early childhood trauma leads to adult psychic dysfunction. This line of causation is fairly easy to understand. More difficult to explain, and more interesting, the opposite outcome: the instances when suffering gives a person the incentive to become a great artist, a wise statesman, or a scientists. ...if one assumes that people have a choice in how they respond to external events, in what meaning they attribute to suffering, then one can interpret the constructive response as normal and the neurotic one as a failure to rise to the challenge, as a breakdown in the ability to flow. / What makes some people able to develop a coherent purpose, while others struggle through an empty or meaningless life? [C. recommend building on past works to learn how to create order, build on books, art, philosophy, of previous thinkers and creators." 234-35
