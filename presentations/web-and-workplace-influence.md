## A hypothesis about influence on the web and the workplace

On the web, seemingly anyone can exert influence if they create and share compelling content. Even without a significant title or position, the web's decentralized model and SEO-surfacing algorithms allow you to boost your visibility in a community. The formula for web influence is simple: create compelling content, share it with a niche community, and repeat over and over. As a writer, you likely already possess the most potent tool for content creation: a mastery of words.

This strategy works for the web. But could you use a similar strategy to exert influence inside the corporation? The dynamics of the corporate landscape differ from the dynamics of the web. Corporations have established hierarchies (even despite a grassroots culture), there are sensitivities around expressing an independent voice, and the content formats and browsing behaviors differ as well. There is also a question of purpose.

Despite these differences, some web strategies can be adjusted to fit the corporation. The underlying mechanism for influence is mostly the same: create compelling content and share with a niche audience. The content won't likely involve blog posts, and sharing mechanisms won't be RSS and social media. The purpose might also differ. But the outcomes could theoretically be similar, to some degree. In this presentation, I'll share some of my thoughts and experiments around workplace influence.
