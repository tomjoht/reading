## A hypothesis about influence on the web and the workplace

On the web, seemingly anyone can exert influence if they create and share compelling content. Even without a significant title or position, the web's decentralized model and SEO-surfacing algorithms allow you to boost your visibility in a community. The formula for web influence is simple: create compelling content, share it with a niche community, and repeat over and over. As a writer, you likely already possess the most potent tool for content creation: a mastery of words.

This strategy works for the web. But could you use a similar strategy to exert influence inside the corporation? The dynamics of the corporate landscape differ from the dynamics of the web. Corporations have established hierarchies (even despite a grassroots culture), there are sensitivities around expressing an independent voice, and the content formats and browsing behaviors differ as well. There is also a question of purpose.

Despite these differences, some web strategies can be adjusted to fit the corporation. The underlying mechanism for influence is mostly the same: create compelling content and share with a niche audience. The content won't likely involve blog posts, and sharing mechanisms won't be RSS and social media. The purpose might also differ. But the outcomes could theoretically be similar, to some degree. In this presentation, I'll share some of my thoughts and experiments around workplace influence.


## Outline

## my hypothesis

* experimenting with this idea

## Web landscape

* independent voice, ability to be an individual expressing an opinion, elaborating at length

## Corporate landscape

* expected to have more purpose behind the effort. not an individual thing but rather promoting a doc department, a group, the reputation of documentation. 

* problem is that the appeal of the blog is all about the independent voice. group blogs don't really work. 

## Three techniques:

* Meeting notes
* Newsletters
* Book clubs

## Main 

## Purpose

* is purpose to aggrandize oneself? visibility for the sake of fame? no, but there are clear downsides to being invisible in the org when it comes to docs: others marginalize your role, no one understands doc processes or standards, there's little thought about docs. 


## Audience

* what is your niche community?
* 
### Content generation

* the most difficult aspect: consistency, regularity, the ability to crank out good content in a short amount of time, each week, with little expectation of any reward.
* it takes time. need to find some natural interest or motivation for this work.

### Irony

* the irony is that we possess the most potent tool for influence: a mastery of language, the ability to create content and push that out, time and again.

### Courage to step out of the shadows

* does take some boldness to push out content when your list is hundreds of people. not really easy to do this. I've become more desensitized from doing this with my personal blog, hitting send for an email that goes to 6,500 people. 




## Newsletter

* almost never read. email is drowning in newsletters. might as well open the door to the outside world and try to shout out your newsletter.
* xPA efforts at a newsletter -- very difficult to get other writers into motion. org politics surfaces -- what if the product is xPA, and you only own one piece of it? what if the other writers drag their feet in contributing? What if the contributions lack any actual insight or interest? it's like coordinating where to have dinner when you have 30 people with varying diets. kind of frustrating, has little impact. 


### Returns on a newsletter

* better to have a highly targeted email for a small group, or a cross-PA email distributed to a much larger group?

* it's pretty much a dead format that no one reads, but once you set up a pattern, it might be an easy thing to keep going.

### Newsletter content

* two questions: what are you working on, what have you recently published. Send it monthly. Rotate the responsibility across your doc group.

### Newsletter format

* use the internal Newsletter tool
* keep it short, link out to longer articles. Track clicks on links with aRT.
