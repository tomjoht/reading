## Soccer photography tips

- include more of the scene and other players in the action
- get on one need to get more eye level with the scene

## Ideal settings
* shutter speed: 1/1000
* aperture: f2-4

the aperture controls how much background stuff is in focus. this can bring the player you've selected more into the focus of the photo, so you want the aperture to be f2-4, or up to f-5.6. but if you set shutter speed priority, the aperture is auto-selected. as such, you control this with the ISO setting.

## ISO
don't go above 400 or you end up with digital noise


## Focus modes

lens compatibility: The D60 only autofocuses with the latest AF-S 

AF-C stands for AF-Continuous. The D60 keeps focusing as the subject moves. Use this for sports and vehicles in motion, like cars, birds and aircraft.


tap info button, then use dial to select Focus mode and switch into AF-C.


AF Area Modes (menu)

You set these by pressing MENU > Custom Setting (pencil) > 03 AF-area mode.

Once in this menu, your choices are:

[xxx] Closest Subject. This lets you shoot (or hand your camera to a non-photographer) and the D60 almost always gives a great, in-focus shot.

This feature works great. I'm always surprised at the great results I get in this mode.

[ x ] Dynamic Area: The D60 first uses whichever area you select with the rear AF Sensor Selector, and proceeds to select other areas automatically if the subject moves in the frame. You won't see which area is selected in the finder, but you can see it on playback if you use the right software.

## Selecting photos

1. Open up all the photos in Preview.
2. Open up Sublime and note all the players' names.
3. For each good photo, add the number next to the player name.
4. Rename all the files to append "x." Then search for X and drag them into a subfolder called "good."
