title: "Draft post for smartphone series: Pinpointing the problem"
---

Email from Jacob Leighty. comes across a bit pigheaded, truculent with the world. i've been trying to figure out exactly what it is about social media that is the problem. clearly i don't condemn all social media, as this blog is one of the quintessential forms of the genre.

reminds me of a chapter in [[Kevin Kelly]]'s What Technology Wants where he looks at the unabomber's arguments, Kyzinski. people who are so anti-tech that they completely remove themselves from it. 

as i've come back to the smartphone, i've been testing the waters a bit to try to identify that part of social media that had extinguished my long-form concentration and reading. 

compare to troubleshooting a tech scenario. i removed all the influences with a digital detox. now i start adding them back little by little to see what re-introduced behavior re-extinguishes reading again. 

i have a hunch that the problematic behavior is scrolling Reddit feeds. Similar to FB or Twitter feeds, you pick your poison. The platforms themselves have lots of good info, but the method of consumption is what warps your brain's attention. it's the information consumption behavior that flows like this:

1. open feed of articles.
2. scroll down until something catches your attention.
3. skim and scan it. prob spend 20 seconds or so. 
4. scroll down until something else catches your attention.
5. skim and scan it. prob spend 20 seconds or so.

Do this for 2+ hrs a day for multiple years and see if you can then switch into this focus mode:

1. open a book with long walls of text and no pretty pictures.
2. read. 
3. OMG this is boring. Let's open a browser and do something else.

If this is the behavior, then perhaps awareness of it is enough to pinpoint the problem. one remedy could be to limit yourself in this mode to no more than 10 min. a day. too long and it becomes a habit. 

you still want news, and you want to be informed about the latest goings-on in your field. we all have our sources for getting this info, and it doesn't make sense to do the following:

1. open a social media feed.
2. find the first article you see.
3. read it from top to bottom in a thorough way.
4. move on to the next article.
5. repeat.

if you did that, you'd probably read 3-4 articles that weren't worth reading in the first place before setting aside the computer/phone and doing something else. 

Johan Hari or someone talks about the infinite scroll and how it was the worst thing ever invented. could be relevant here.

another thing about reading. it really helps if the author has similar questions as you. this is why i really like a personal angle to a book. i want to know what prompted the author's interest in the subject, what questions are they trying to answer. if i can't get a sense of that, it feels very disinterested. 

that said, just because i like this personal angle, it doesn't mean i want to read memoir and lengthy biographical descriptions that are thin on ideas (if any) and long on things like the clothes someone is wearing who the author interacted with on some occasion. case in point: picked up Never Lost Again. After 5 pages, could not bring myself to continue. there was a good fact or two in those pages, but then it devolved into crap. i looked in the back -- no sources cited. really? your life isn't that interesting, even if you invented the app that became Google Maps!

coming back to the poison. if this is the behavior, and we can recognize it, then is there an antidote beyond setting time limits or avoiding it? maybe also add one more awareness: what's catching your attention:

- negativity bias
- the grotesque
- novelty bias

are you being manipulated by the algorithm?
