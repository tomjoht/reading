title: Systems thinking thoughts

sounds good in theory but in practice you realize how complex this. understanding a technical system and all the parts, how they fit and work together, etc., is an enormous undertaking. unclear who the audience is for this. is it something writes can even do? 

another question is what scale would you describe? for example, the Gizmo API handles X versus 50 + pages of details about this API.

maybe writers have to go even higher up to connect the parts at a much higher level? 

c4model.com zooming in and out.

what approach to describing something so massive? 

who will maintain such a thing?

what use case are you solving for? onboarding? when users have to work across teams? i'm not sure this is the right approach.
