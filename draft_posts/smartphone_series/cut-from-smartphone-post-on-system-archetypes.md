Senge talks about the cycle of addiction as an example of the limited growth archetype. One takes up drinking as a way to deal with some other issue. The drinking makes the person feel good for a time. But the drinking soon introduces its own problems, creating a downward trajectory for the individual.

My dad struggled with alcoholism. I think he started drinking out of a general anxiety and fear about his career. He stayed in college as a way to avoid engaging in the world. The bottle made him feel good. But then he slid into alcoholism, and it derailed so many of his other plans. 

I don't believe I have an addiction resembling anything of the sort depicted by Crawford's death instinct or that of an addict. I'm not Nietszche's Last Man struggling with an existential meaningless of a commodotized existence. Like everyone, I experience negative feelings and stress at times, which does prompt me to watch an episode or two of TV as a way to escape. But this is all normal. Nothing has ever interfered with my life. 

I guess I just want more. I want to find a more productive space in the evenings or day where I engage in the pursuits that Senge describes as personal mastery. I have a creative tension in which I aim to achieve much more than I do. I want to unlock the ability to focus in ways that makes me uber productive and allows me to achieve more, in shorter timelines. I want to write that book, hit a home run at work, help my kids become mature adults, go on more dates with my wife, and so on, but after a day's work, I come home exhausted, or "knackered" as one person put it, and it's hard to pony up the energy for some excellence. In this weakened state, I seek out a means of distraction, and before I know it, I'm watching Resident Evil, laying on my bed, looking for something sweet to eat while shutting out the world.

Crawford's *The World Outside Your Head* explores the ways that our technological age introduces manipulation that distorts our own preferences. Are smartphones and the Internet a kind of digital Pringle -- we eat one and we can't stop ourselves, we're hooked/addicted, craving more and more. We need that dopamine hit from the like on Facebook, or whatever?

Or are smartphones just a more convenient replacement for TV, which is a more visually appealing medium than radio, which supplanted some other means of distraction?




that poem, "I have wasted my life." james? celebration of doing nothing.

How much downtime is appropriate, and why might I be overindulging in downtime? Is the appropriate amount of downtime per day 1 hour? 3 hours? 

Perhaps by overworking in some areas, I've taken on too much stress in my life and as a compensating factor, I've resorted to more downtime.

perhaps spending my time watching screens during my downtime is like eating junk food -- not very filling. maybe exercise, or some other hobbies might be more rejuvenating.





- noticed over past few weeks that i've been reading less.
- started letting some rules slide. bringing laptop to bed. watching Netflix. e.g., sucked into Stranger Things series, Old Man, Resident Evil, etc. 
- let myself read more nytimes.com, espn.com. carry phone in pocket more. 
- Netflix compensates for lack of smartphone. shifting the focus. noticed that i'm watching a lot of TV.

system archetypes describe recurring patterns that happen in systems.

balancing processes in a system. cut off smartphone distraction, but allowed attentional capacity to be consumed by another device/service: Netflix. Cut off Netflix and perhaps I become consumed by something else. perhaps i just shift to junk food fiction. then have i achieved anything?

- our attentional capacity drifts to what it easiest to consume, to what entertains us.
- reading can be hard, involves adjusting thought processes,


we shift the burden of the fundamental problem to the easiest scapegoat: the smartphone, the tv, the manipulative algorithm of big tech that we can't see but which is surely nudging and distorting our inner desires and preferences. but are these symptoms of the problem? what is the real problem for which we are reading less?

why are we so easily distracted?

comment from linkedin: "my ability to excel in my role depends on how well i can focus on the task at hand." why do we jump around so much, procrastinate, switch contexts? need more singular focus.
