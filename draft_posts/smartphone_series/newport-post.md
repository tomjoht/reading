# coming back to productivity

## Intro

In the last post in this series, I explored ways some systems thinking ideas about how systems do natural rebalancing, so that if you make a change in one area, you might experience a temporary gain only to find that the system compensates in some other area, eliminating your win. My abandonment of smartphone led to a temporary win with long-form concentration and reading, but it didn't take long to find another form of distraction through television. 

When I couldn't identify the true source behind distraction, I decided that maybe we point the finger too much at social media when instead long-form concentration and focus is simply a difficult skill to develop. As such, I decided to read Cal Newport's *Deep Work: Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy World*, which is one of the best business books and currently has 17k+ reviews on Amazon with 4.5 stars rating. The book lives up to the hype: I think it taught me the secret to productivity.

## The basic idea

I'll summarize and comment on Newport's ideas at length, but in case you want the TLDR instead, for me it boils down to this: set aside several 90-minute focus sessions a day in which you block out distractions and focus on an important task. That's it. If you can do this, you'll be wildly productive. "Three to four hours a day, five days a week, of uninterrupted and carefully directed concentration, it turns out, can produce a lot of valuable output," Newport says (16).

There are a lot more nuances here. For example, Newport mentions different working models, from the total hermit who disappears days at a time to more of a journalist mode where someone disappears for a half hour here and there during other work, but the fundamental idea is the same: you need to dedicate periods of sustained focus on deep work.

Newport also spends a lot of time arguing for the value of deep work over shallow work, trying to convince the reader that deep work is more rewarding and satisfying than immersion in shallow activities.

## Definitions of deep and shallow work

First, let's start with some basic definitions. Newport defines deep work as follows:

> Deep Work: Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill, and are hard to replicate." (3)

Notice that deep work pushes your cognitive capabilities, meaning it requires focus and concentration. It's usually not something you can do while watching Netflix out of the corner of your screen.

In contrast, shallow work is as follows: 

> Shallow Work: Non-cognitively demanding, logistical-style tasks, often performed while distracted. These efforts tend to not create much new value in the world and are easy to replicate." (6)

In distinguishing between deep work and shallow work, Newport says to use this test: consider whether the work could be done by a bright, young college graduate (9). Ask yourself, "How long would it take (in months) to train a smart recent college graduate with no specialized training in my field to complete this task?" (229). If the answer is that the college grad could learn to do this task within a few weeks of training, then you're not doing deep work.

## Why prioritize deep work

Newport says that our natural tendency is toward easy, shallow work. When we naturally follow the "principle of least resistance," which means "we will tend toward behaviors that are easiest in the moment" (58). In fact, we often busy ourselves with tasks that make it seem like we're doing a lot of work -- responding to email, interacting in chat, attending meetings, doing little stuff, and so on -- at the expense of a deeper focused state (74).


But focusing on deep work yields a more satisfying, rewarding life. "A deep life is a good life," Newport says (18). Deep work isn't just a technique for productivity, it's the key to a richer, more meaningful life.

New port says, 

> A workday driven by the shallow, from a neurological perspective, is likely to be a draining and upsetting day, even if most of the shallow things that capture your attention seem harmless or fun. ...to increase the time you spend in a state of depth is to leverage the complex machinery of the human brain in a way that for several different neurological reasons maximizes the meaning and satisfaction you'll associate with your working life. (82)

If we occupy our day with little meaningless tasks, checking our email obsessively, doing small tasks that don't require much thought or contemplation, we're spending our time on frivolous errands that are the equivalent of junk food in a diet. Prefer more substance and you'll feel the rewards of it. 

At the extreme, focusing on deep work can lead to states of flow. Quoting Csikszenmihalyi, a psychologist, Newport says, "The best moments usually occur when a person's body or mind is stretched to its limits in a voluntary effort to accomplish something difficulty and worthwhile" (84).

Summarizing Csikszenmihalyi's theory of flow, Newport says, "...the feeling of going deep is *in itself* very rewarding. Our minds like this challenge, regardless of the subject. ... the act of going deep orders the consciousness in a way that makes life worthwhile" (85).

Last weekend I spent much of my time cleaning and organizing our house while preparing for a birthday party. I didn't spend much time writing or doing other deep tasks. At the end of the weekend, I felt a bit like I'd spent my weekend time poorly. Sure, our bathroom drawers and closet were organized, and I'd watched a lot of sports, but I had a sense of not having accomplished anything. There wasn't any deeper satisfaction.

Newport also draws upon studies by Winifred Gallagher who found that what people focus most on tends to define their state of happiness. Where you spend your time and thinking is what shapes the contours of your life:

> Our brains instead construct our worldview based on *what we pay attention to.*. ...Gallagher's theory, therefore, predicts that if you spend enough time in this state, your mind will understand your world as rich in meaning and importance. (77-79)

Gallagher's "connection between attention and happiness" suggests that if you can focus your attention on deep tasks that matter, you'll be happier (76).

Overall, Newport tries to persuade you that a deep life is time better spent. I think most of us will readily agree, but the question is more of a tactical one: how do you carve out times to focus in deep ways? The noisiness of the world makes this hard, even seemingly impossible, to do.

## Carving out periods of sustained focus

Newport doesn't force a one-size-fits-all model onto deep work. He cites several example models. In the extreme, a person might retreat to a secluded cabin to work uninterrupted for days at a time. On the opposite end, a busy family man might escape for short blocks of time (such as 30 minutes) to work in a bedroom. In the middle of these extremes are the 90-minute focus sessions that I think might fit me best.

Newport says that David Dewane, an architecture professor, has a model of an Eudaimonia machine that involves rooms that progress from socially interactive at the outer layer to deeply immersive (like an inner sanctuary) at the inner level. Dewane's model is for people to retreat for periods of time into the inner recesses of the building for deep, immersive thought, and then to periodically surface back at the outer layers with more social interaction. Newport explains:

> He imagines a process in which you spend ninety minutes inside, take a ninety-minute break, and repeat two or three times -- at which point you brain will have achieved its limit of concentration for the day. (97)

I'm focusing more on this technique because I think it fits me best. Newport is careful to recommend that you find what works for you. "You must be careful to choose a philosophy that fits your specific circumstances, as a mismatch here can derail your deep work habit before it has a chance to solidify," he says (102). In fact, near the end, Newport reveals that he follows more of the family man (journalist mode) who disappears for short stretches of time; he can't simply withdraw from life for consecutive days or longer at a time like a hermit.

The 90-minute sessions resonate with me because I've found focus sessions to work well for me. I [wrote about focus sessions earlier](/blog/writing-productivity-through-focus-sessions/). I use an app called "Focus" and would more or less follow a Pomodoro technique of focusing for short periods of time. However, I'd become accustomed to two habits that we're working so well: anytime I wanted to stop, I simply paused the timer. Then I resumed it later. And I kept the sessions shorter, to either 20 minutes or 60 minutes. For some reason, I'd gotten away from doing these focus sessions, and I can't remember why.

Reading Newport's book, I decided to tweak the focus sessions a bit. Instead of pausing when I wanted a break, I instead try as much as possible not to hit pause. (I'm not a monster, though. If my wife or kids need me, or someone interrupts me with an information need, I'll attend to it. But I'll try as much as possible not to break the session, especially not to check my email or do some other mental break such as checking the news or sports.)

It's important to reduce context-switching so that you can get more into a state of flow. The more you context-switch during the 90-minute session, the less effective it becomes. Newport says, 
"To produce at your peak level, you need to work for extended periods with full concentration on a single task free from distraction" (44). Don't even a glance at email every 10 min because this creates context switching and carries over "attention residue." For example, suppose you check your email during a focus session and find that an email gets you thinking about some other topic. Even when you try to get back into your focus session, you'll have some attention residue from the other context that dilutes your attention.

I'm also trying to train my brain's muscles for more extended periods of concentration. Newport says that even when people want to focus on a task, they often can't because they're so used to distraction. Newport says:

> Unfortunately, when it comes to replacing distraction with focus, matters are not so simple. To understand why this is true let's take a closer look at one of the main obstacles to going deep: the urge to turn your attention toward something more superficial. Most people recognize that this urge can complicate efforts to concentrate on hard things, but most underestimate its regularity and strength. ... you can expect to be bombarded with the desire to do anything *but* work deeply throughout the day... (98-99)

So I recognize that my general inclination is to break up this 90-minute focus session and do something easier, such as glance at the news and my email. By resisting, I'm building up my ability to focus in a more sustained way. "The ability to concentrate intensely is a skill that must be trained," Newport says (157).

## Routines

Another technique for carving our periods of sustained focus is to rely on routines. If you can build in structures to your day that get you into habits, you'll be much better. Newport says, "The key to developing a deep work habit is to move beyond good intentions and add *routines* and *rituals* to your working life designed to minimize the amount of your limited willpower necessary to transition into and maintain a state of unbroken concentration" (100).

These routines and rituals kick in when your willpower falls to a minimum. (Rituals are also a technique mentioned by Matthew Crawford in *....)

For me, I find that writing during the first hour of the day works best for me. I often wake up earlier than others, so this time of day has fewer distractions. Further, as I get older, I've noticed that my brain works best during the first hours of the day. As the afternoon and evening set in, my brain gets more tired and I have less energy for mentally consuming tasks such as writing. Therefore, if I can get in 1-2 hours of writing in the morning, and then save the later hours of the day for editing or other less cognitively demanding tasks, I'm more productive.

Newport says that rituals are important because your success will depend on your ability "to go deep, again and again" (119). These focus sessions can't merely be a one-off activity that you squeeze in every other day. Referencing high achievers in literary and scientific fields, Newport says, "there's no way to win a Pulitzer Prize or conceive a grand theory without pushing your brain to its limits" (119).

## Enemies to sustained focus

Fitting in periods of sustained focus can be especially difficult in corporate culture, where you're expected to be responsive chat and email in continuous ways. If you disconnect at work, people will likely think that you're not working. But if you open yourself up to constant disruption, you'll become entrapped in shallow activities all day.

Figuring out the tactics of deep work can be more challenging than the strategy itself. For me, when I have several thirty-minute meetings that punctuate the day, it can be difficult to focus deeply. First, I usually have to prepare for the meetings, which means coming up with agenda topics. After the meeting, I'm somewhat emotionally depleted, so I need some recovery time. I also want to type up the notes and send them out, then create tickets for any action items. A thirty-minute meeting therefore takes at least an hour. Add lunch on top of three meetings, and my actual time is much less. If I look at the clock and see that my next meeting is in 20 minutes, it demotivates me from jumping into a 90-minute focus session.

Therefore, beyond the early morning 90-minute session, where distractions are at a minimum, I might need to adjust the sessions to fit the schedule of the day. Alternatively, I could try to adjust my meetings so that they're all back to back, which would allow for more sustained focus periods.

In short, carving out several 90-minute sessions a day isn't easy. It might involve ignoring people for chunks of time, which could seem off-putting in a "ubiquitous *culture of connectivity*, where one is expected to read and respond to e-mails (and related communication) quickly" (56).

The paradox, though, is that these same behaviors that might seem like you're not working are the exact behaviors that lead to greater productivity. If it takes you 90 minutes before you respond to your manager's chat message, that might give the impression that you're "away" from your desk during work time, maybe running personal errands or going on leisure walks. Hardly! During this time, you might actually be sinking the necessary time in to get that complex documentation written.

At my work (and elsewhere), there's a common practice of writing manuals for yourself. I actually created a lengthy guide that explains, among other styles and preferences, that I have most notifications turned off and so might not respond immediately to chat messages because I prefer to get into modes of deep focus. But even if people don't read my user manual (I don't expect them to), these same people will appreciate an increased productivity of documentation output in exchange for slower communication responses.

Part of the problem, Newport explains, is that for knowledge workers, the metrics of productivity aren't clear. It's hard to measure output, so the person that appears to be busy (by being visible online) might actually be the least productive. With academic work, you can measure productivity through the number of peer-reviewed articles published each year. 

As a technical writer, measuring word count with documentation is much more challenging. For example, I could tell you the number of lines changed in code commits I've submitted, but the auto-generated Javadoc that I imported several times will drastically distort these metrics. Publishing content someone else wrote could likewise distort metrics. It's much harder to author content from scratch. But someone could equally argue that it's better to get engineers to write anyway, so how exactly do you measure your output? What if your output involves distilling and focusing the required work in bug tickets and delegating them out to the writers that would be most successful in tackling them?

Even with these difficulties, I have noticed that if I can squeeze in several 90-minute focus sessions, I am wildly productive. Honestly, I've written the bulk of this post in one such session. The other week at work I had a complex documentation task that involved describing some new and confusing attributes added to an API. I'd been meaning to get to these attributes for more than a week but couldn't make progress. One day I sat down for about two hours and completed a first draft. That first draft (where you create something from nothing) is the most mentally taxing, but then the subsequent edits that follow involve much less demanding work.

Here's the secret: If you can complete three of these 90-minute sessions a day, you'll be so productive, you will finish your work earlier than you anticipated it would take. In my mind, some tasks seem so gnarly and complex that I dread working on them, thinking that they'll take days of writing and work. In reality, in a good focus session might wrap up the session entirely! Especially if I'm working during my peak performance hours (early in the morning), I can make a lot more progress than I thought.

## Limits to focused work

After I cranked out the description of those complex attributes, my brain actually hurt. I could feel my mental wheels were taxed. That's a good sign that I was actually engaged in deep work: I could feel the muscles in my brain were worked over, like I'd just gone to the gym.

Newport says most people can't sustain states of focused concentration for more than 1-2 hours a day. Even the most experienced professionals tap out at for hours. Newport writes, "The most adept deep thinker cannot spend more than four of these hours in a state of true depth" (220). 

I agree with this limit, which aligns with my general writing method for this blog over the years. I typically spend an hour writing a post in the morning or so. If I can space out the writing to 1-2 hours a day over the course of a week, I can make a lot of progress. With writing, it's hard to sustain an active writing effort in any genre for more than four hours, especially if you're generating new material. (This is why it pains me to see my children procrastinate essays right before the deadline &mdash; I know they probably can't sustain a long marathon writing session, especially after midnight.)

Newport says "once you've hit your deep work limit in a given day, you'll experience diminishing rewards if you try to cram in more. Shallow work, therefore, doesn't become dangerous until after you add enough to begin to crowd out your bounded deep efforts for the day" (220).

Newport isn't against shallow work; he just says to prioritize the deep work first in your day, then once you've hit your limit, cycle in the shallow work. In my experience, editing existing writing (improving sentence flow, removing typos, and other proofreading) fits into the shallow work category.

## Enemies to distraction

Newport devotes a good chunk of the book to enemies of distraction. Chief among these include social media and email. I've purposely downplayed the treatment of social media in my summary here because I think we tend to want a distraction monster to point the finger at. Certainly, I agree that social media can interrupt our ability to focus and short-circuit the wiring in our brains. But really, I think the key to productivity is to devote 90-minute distraction-free sessions during your day. If you engage in social media outside of those blocks, it doesn't seem to harmful to me. Newport does caution: "Spend enough time in a state of frenetic shallowness and you *permanently* reduce your capacity to perform deep work" (7). Certainly, if you can sustain disruption-free focus sessions of 90-minutes during the day, the idea that social media has permanently reduced your capacity might be overstating its harm. 

One final comment from the book is Newport's advice on email. Email tends to be a huge time sink that frustrate people. Newport recommends putting more work on the email sender, especially through filters. For the technical writer, you can make the same strategy work for you. Instead of allowing people to file doc bugs with a vague description of the work, which then require you to follow up and gather the information (for example, due dates, source materials, reviewer contacts, test systems, etc.), load this information into the bug template itself. The more painful you make it for requesters to supply information up front, the less pain you'll have in fulfilling the task. 

If people skip the required information fields, assign them bug back to them before adding it your plate. You can also specialize your templates so that you distinguish between longer tasks and short doc bugs. Obviously, if someone is filing a doc bug to correct a typo, you don't want to require them to complete details about product requirements documents and release timelines. You can find a suggested [intake template for small requests here](/learnapidoc/docapis_managing_small_doc_requests.html#intake-template-for-small-requests). For larger requests, pull fields into a template from those mentioned in this section: [4. Create project plans for the documentation projects

## Conclusion

Overall, I highly recommend Cal Newport's *Deep Work*. Newport says that in a world that is becoming increasingly consumed with shallow work (from social media to email and other shallow tasks), those who can focus on deep work possess a highly valuable skill. The larger hypothesis of his book is that "The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly *rare* at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly *valuable* in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive" (14). Most of us will agree that devoting several sessions of deep focus (whether 90 minutes or some other time period) will lead to significant gains in productivity. The challenge is in finding the right tactics and techniques to make those focus sessions a reality.
