Prompt: Tell a story from your life, describing an experience that either demonstrates your character or helped to shape it. (Maximum length: 650 words)

- the story of how she went from disliking math to liking math constitutes her math biography. perhaps it is a math conversion story.

- stereotypes about girls not liking math. both parents English majors, older sister a history major, and other sisters vocal about how much they hate math. so how did Callie come to love it? wasn't always that way.

- several years in STEM program. forced her to skip two years of math, thrown into math two years ahead of their grade. was initially disorienting, hard.

- had teacher bent on teaching abstract concepts only, wanted students to arrive at their own conclusions about how to apply them. the method didn't work, was just confusing. things weren't clicking for them yet.

- changed with ninth grade math. was initially getting bored with math because it was easy. realized that I had to come up with ways to challenge myself. [more concrete detail?] teacher taught in a more concrete way, going over rules and patterns. started to realize that they could solve problems by applying rules, patterns, approaches. there was a set of patterns they could follow to solve problems. opened things up.

- also started to see how even basic math, such as addition and subtraction, extended into other areas, such as imaginary numbers, and had more applications than these concepts initially appeared on the surfaced. started to become more intrigued by it.

- had a big science project in STEM that involved mealworms, scientific method, calculations, measurements, very systematic approach. they liked the problem solving approach -- figuring out whether the data supported their hypothesis about mealworms eating styrofoam.

- another project was coding an app. used modified form of Python. what started out simple ended up being 40 pages of code when printed out. use of variables, substitution, equations, manipulating information. started to see how same mathematical concepts and approach extended into computer programming realm.

- started tutoring in math. found that they had a lot of patience and could help students through difficult times, even when students were literally crying out of frustration. took class on teaching (careers with children) and would incorporate methods, such as helping students talk through the problem, not just solve it for them. also tutored sisters in math.

- senior year, really wanted to take two advanced math classes but also needed a science credit. ended up taking physics over the summer so they could take both Calculus BC and Statistics during their senior year.

- likes Calculus the most. seems the most useful, applicable to wide range of problems.

- future career, thinking of data science. wants to use math to solve problems.

- finding out what you're good at is part of your identity formation during high school
