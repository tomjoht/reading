# Essay

Prompt: Tell a story from your life, describing an experience that either demonstrates your character or helped to shape it. (Maximum length: 650 words)

more explicit: explain how your character will help you succeed in college.

outline:
- experience tutoring Hope, who is crying.
- callie being a sort of paradox of pathos and logos, or emotion and reason. on the one hand, super empathetic character. empathy is defining quality of callie. but also really good at math. math is cold, logical, systematic, while empathy is warm, fuzzy, emotional. seen as opposing emotions. but just maybe, empathy could actually be helpful.




- the story of how she went from disliking math to liking math constitutes her math biography. perhaps it is a math conversion story.

- stereotypes about girls not liking math. both parents English majors, older sister a history major, and other sisters vocal about how much they hate math. so how did Callie come to love it? wasn't always that way.

- several years in STEM program. forced her to skip two years of math, thrown into math two years ahead of their grade. was initially disorienting, hard.

- had teacher bent on teaching abstract concepts only, wanted students to arrive at their own conclusions about how to apply them. the method didn't work, was just confusing. things weren't clicking for them yet.

- changed with ninth grade math. was initially getting bored with math because it was easy. realized that I had to come up with ways to challenge myself. [more concrete detail?] teacher taught in a more concrete way, going over rules and patterns. started to realize that they could solve problems by applying rules, patterns, approaches. there was a set of patterns they could follow to solve problems. opened things up.

- also started to see how even basic math, such as addition and subtraction, extended into other areas, such as imaginary numbers, and had more applications than these concepts initially appeared on the surfaced. started to become more intrigued by it.

- had a big science project in STEM that involved mealworms, scientific method, calculations, measurements, very systematic approach. they liked the problem solving approach -- figuring out whether the data supported their hypothesis about mealworms eating styrofoam.

- another project was coding an app. used modified form of Python. what started out simple ended up being 40 pages of code when printed out. use of variables, substitution, equations, manipulating information. started to see how same mathematical concepts and approach extended into computer programming realm.

- started tutoring in math. found that they had a lot of patience and could help students through difficult times, even when students were literally crying out of frustration. took class on teaching (careers with children) and would incorporate methods, such as helping students talk through the problem, not just solve it for them. also tutored sisters in math.

- senior year, really wanted to take two advanced math classes but also needed a science credit. ended up taking physics over the summer so they could take both Calculus BC and Statistics during their senior year.

- likes Calculus the most. seems the most useful, applicable to wide range of problems.

- future career, thinking of data science. wants to use math to solve problems.

- finding out what you're good at is part of your identity formation during high school


UW personal essay prompt

Tell a story from your life, describing an experience that either demonstrates your character or helped to shape it.


[Translation: Use an experience from your life to demonstrate how it shaped your character and how that character will make you succeed in college. In other words, it’s more of an argumentative essay in which you prove that you’ll be successful in college, and it follows the same STAR behavioral pattern (situation-task-action-result) as Amazon’s interviews, in which previous experience is used to predict future success. Show the following:


“Drive — you push yourself to succeed no matter how long the odds.
- taking physics during summer so they could take two math classes during the regular year.
- expanding scope of mealworm assignment into something much larger

Intellectual Curiosity — you love learning for the fun of it.
- found that making something more challenging is what draws you in. reference to chzikmehaiy's flow? 

Initiative — you challenge the status quo, you take the lead to make things better.
- 

Contribution — you give back to your community.
-

Diversity of Experiences — you have experiences or a background that give you a unique perspective. 
- 



Find experiences that demonstrate each of the above qualities, which is what colleges believe you need to succeed. “The best way to prove you exhibit your Traits, Personas, and Defining Words is by identifying the life experiences that show you putting these aspects of your character into practice. This is where storytelling comes in—by telling your stories, you will help your reader see the world through your eyes, and you will prove that you will be successful in college and beyond.”

maybe main story is to be driven by internal motivation. this is what carries people through to succeed. and how did callie develop internal motivation?

what about their empathy? isn't that character? how does their ability to approach problems with a set of rules align with callie's sense of empathy? 

how does empathy help callie succeed in math? that is the big questions.

While working with people with autism, Baron-Cohen (yup, he’s the cousin of Sacha) developed a theory that women are driven stronger to empathy — that is, when the feelings of others alter your own feelings. Men, and people with autism, are more likely to focus on analytic approaches. (However, the gendered aspect of the theory has come under fire. https://www.inverse.com/article/12889-scientists-discover-link-between-great-empathy-skills-and-being-bad-at-math

maybe present the idea that empathy is typically a feminine trait while math (more systematic, logical thinking) belongs to more masculine traits. callie is the perfect blend of both, which perhaps why she uses they instead of he or she. that callie should be both highly empathetic but also interested and curious in math seems like a paradox. is it?

hypothesis: empathy is the secret to being great at math. first thought that empathy would help her tutor. example: the crying person hope she was tutoring. molly in moments of frustration. lucy. contrast with mom's domineering, emotionally aggressive approach that made everyone feel intimidated and dumb. 

but empathy more than this. problem solving is about shifting perspectives, learning to see a problem from a nonstandard appraoch. to think outside the box, you have to shift your mindset outside yourself, into another point of view. this shifting of points of points of view is how they solve problems.

example: .... a really tough problem to solve. how callie solved it.

main argument: empathy in relationships is what launches you to succeed in math. this answers both the character question (empathy) and how it will help you succeed in college. 

https://educationblog.oup.com/theory-of-knowledge/is-mathematics-a-gateway-to-empathy. Roger Antonsen - changing perspective is what helps you solve problems. "Taking a stance as a teacher, he comments on consciously using metaphors as a teaching tool, and specifically on using the variations in mathematical representations as a metaphor for changing perspectives – and thereby understanding more fully. “My claim,” he says (11:02) is that you understand something if you have the ability to view it from different perspectives.”"

maybe look at thrivers to research empathy.

of course empathy can help with teaching moments.

what experiences demonstrate callie's empathy? 
- listens to people, geniunely asks questions
- easily makes friends, but also attracts broken people.

is it empathy when a problem ruminates in your mind until you solve it?

acknowledge downsides of empathy. can be manipulated, when others are having a bad day, so then do you. when others are in distress, so too are you. 

math is cold, logical, reason-based. empathy belongs to emotional realms, is human, compassionate. one would think they are opposite ends of the spectrum, but not so... [this approach would make an interesting, original argument.]

does the equation become another person? someone to understand? in the same way that callie unconsciously looks at patterns and seeks to understand others' behavior, maybe she looks at math problems in the same way, as entities to understand. she has tools to dissect the patterns that will reveal their underlying character. her problem solving is the same thing going on in the empathy realm. 

on the surface, people say empathy is about seeing things from other people's perspectives, but it's much more than that. it's being pulled into another person's emotions. are they happy? then you're happy. are they angry? it upsets you. are they distressed? you become distressed too. in this way, empathy becomes a mechanism by which others can manipulate and influence you, and you can't really help it. you get pulled by their emotions.

this empathy of course has upsides. i'm everyone's best friend...i like being around people, and they like being around me. i'm not a narcissist. i listen and ask questions.

but it dawned on me that perhaps empathy was a way of looking at the world that could be helpful in math. that foreign problem was like a person shutting the door, not letting you in?
