the concluding chapter

- mike commits suicide
- manfred's meteoric rise
- venezuela as a failed state
- the path i took after my mission
- leaving the church
- manfred reaching out on FB
- life after being mormon
- why i left -- everyone wants a reason
- you choose what you do emotionally and then justify it with an intellectual reason
- surprisingly, lots of people don't really want to know why you left
- include some of those things you wrestled with in that post
- how do you explain the burning in the bosom?
- how do you tell a convert that you're no longer a member?
- molly goes to sunset lake camp, friend ask why she doesn't go to church. all the concepts so foreign. people thanking jesus for bringing them to this camp. says jesus didn't bring her, parents did. jesus worship is just weird, foreign. as it always was with me.
