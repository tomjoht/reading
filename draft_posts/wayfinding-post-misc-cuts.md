title: stuff cut from the wayfinding post series

The allure of autonomous vehicles is that so much of our travel along monotonous highways slashed across the landscape, often bordered by sound-insulating walls so as to limit one's view, already feels like a waste of time. If our brains are on autopilot while driving, responding to GPS-simulated instructions, wouldn't it be better to spend that time in some other way? ... I see the driverless car as representing yet another severance between our movement through space and time and the pleasure of effort and autonomy. GPS relieves us of the need to form cognitive maps, and driverless cars relieve us of the need to look away from our screens and take note of directly experienced phenomena in the environment. In seeking maximum speed and ultimate efficiency, the autonomous vehicle cocoons us from the physics of movement at high speeds and the burning of fuel. Rather than plunge us into reality, an autonomous vehicle era."  285-86

"The driver quite literally relies on the virtual representation of the road rather than their unmediated perception of the physical road." 273

Harry Heft, professor of environmental psychology. "The GPS diffuses that whole way of engaging the world ... because you don't even really have to *look* at the world very much." 273

"Aging people who practice using their spatial memory have a more active hippocampus, a larger hippocampus, and better cognitive health." 267


knowledge is no longer tied to direct experience. 223. Huth and the kayak lifechanging experience.


"...chronic stress, untreated depression, insomnia, and alcohol abuse can all shrink hippocampal volume." 265




'"Our results fit with models in which the hippocampus stimulates journeys on future possible paths while the prefrontal cortext helps us to plan which ones will get to our destination." Spiers talking to reporter. "When we have technology telling us which way to go, however, these parts of the brain simply don't respond to the street network. In that sense our brain has switched off its interest in the streets around us." 272-73

Veronoique Bohbot does not use GPS. While she was careful to point out that no one has yet designed a study to test whether GPS use causes hippocampal atrophy, there is plenty of evidence that following turn-by-turn directions means we are simply not using a spatial strategy to wayfind. In fact, using a GPS is very much like using the response strategy that exercises the caudate nucleus at a cost to the hippocamus. And because of the remarkable plasticity of the brain, not activating and exercising the hippocampus leads to decreased gray matter. Scientists do know that turn-by-turn directions activate the caudate nucleus, and its response strategy bypasses the creation of cognitive maps." 272

 Bohbot talking: "My gut instinct is yes, if people stop using their brains and totally devote themselves to their handheld devices to find their way around the world, that could have a negative effective on getting around the spillover effects on other things like memory." 272

"The crucial difference between the two methods, the researchers argued, was decision-making -- GPS users were not engaged in making decisions." 273



"What good could possibly come from outsourcing cognitive processes that were an essential aspect of making humans human?" 276

LIke the invention of the wheel, car, train, and airplane before us, technologies like the Hyperloop and future commercial space ventures will realign whole economies and patterns of movement. They may also realign the human mind." 278 author says how we distort our sense of time and space, shrinking it. 

"Time--saving it, managing it, maximizing it, escaping it, denying it --strikes me as one of the prime concerns and anxieties of modern life, and hence a metric by which we judge the quality of our travel. How fast is it, how easy to distract ourselves from the means and act of it, the burning of fuel, the people and places we fly over? 'We're not selling transportation, we're selling time,' promises Hyperloop."279-80

"Of course, navigational devices like maps, compasses, and sextants also fit Borgmann's device paradigm, because they outsource to some degree the formidable experience, observation, and memory needed to undertake skilled navigation. But even these inventions required a level of environmental awareness and orientation, as well as an understanding of topography of celestial phenomena. It wasn't until the twentieth century that navigational technology released us from needing to pay *any* [[attention]] at all." 283


GPS doesn't require you to be observant/aware of your environment. 

"The highway system is so disconnected form the terrain and the topology. I think what GPS does is lead you even further away from that." 274




"Part of the problem is parents' incessant management of their children's time. "I think they've missed a kind of self-guided, nonorganized activity, nonsports activity growing up. Wandering around, getting into things. .... most of my colleagues I work with seem to have found their careers by being slightly disorganized. Lucking into something, you know?" Joe Stilgoe. 292-93

children can no longer roam or wander about due to the city roadscape. 292

quoting a study: "Autonomy is a key to the acquisition of spatial skills, therefore the development of these skills can be hindered if children cannot move independently in the outdoor environment." 294

"For Stilgoe, the ubiquity of smartphones can never be a good thing. His career has been dedicated to creating thirst in his students for curiosity, exploration, and wonder ---- believing them to be in fact the keystones of true intellect. Smartphones don't open the user up to their surroundings, they funnel attention into themselves and a universe where everything is known, mapped, and accessible." 294

## My conclusions

probably never develop great wayfinding skills. you think you'll crack the code to wayfinding but then realize that it's not a simple secret. it's knowing the land well enough to feel your way. but i'm no longer beating myself up about this, or thinking that i'm somehow deficient and it's my fault. reasons for lack of wayfinding skills:

* not closely connected with land. travel through mediated experience of car, reducing noise, etc. one reason i liked riding a motorcycle so much was the immersion in an environment, directly experiencing the outdoors. is why i like biking too.
  
* travel too quickly through land. a car moves you much too fast to really notice anything. e.g., traveling 75mph down freeway.

* street navigation doesn't have the same logic as something you might intuit from nature, from wind or wave patterns, or starlight. how do you predict that a certain street route will take you across I-5 from Capitol Hill over to Fremont? still working on logic of what a parkway, blvd, way, court, place, etc. is. sure you can suss out some order in naming patterns, but it's so seemingly random and chaotic.

* i could probably get better at reading roads. names signify intent. is this a road that will go straight or end up fizzling? will it curve around? other cars on it, width of road, stoplights or signs, type of road. does it have sidewalks? power lines? noise level? direction of the flow of most traffic? not sure i ever stop to examine the details. 

* not much point in wayfinding. all cultures the author studies are sort of going extinct. inuit ride snowmobiles and use GPS more. our gain and how you get ahead doesn't rely on wayfinding. more helpful is technical wayfinding, finding your way through a technical issue, being able to solve a problem, understand how to organize a group. seems like that kind of thinking is minimized. author's ability to organize hundreds of sources into a coherent, interesting narrative -- this is an impressive skill, so what if you can't find your way across the land. you aren't an idiot.

## Some positives

* there is a psychological comfort in knowing where you're going, without having to rely on GPS for everything. can focus more fully, scan, anticipate. constantly glancing at a screen while driving really sucks. it's super distracting. kind of anxiety producing and nerve racking. now you must look ahead, behind, at screen, etc. eyes bouncing around. you're more in the moment when you're driving, and the busier the more elements there are on the road, the more important this becomes. just being more focused, more holistically aware, is kind of a big deal. 
  
* GPS has an egocentric orientation that probably isn't all that helpful. some other cultures don't have this egocentric bent in their culture. this is one reason why the directions never really stick -- it's always just left right or straight. but if you turn on allocentric view in maps, it does become confusing. e.g., turn left when you see car bend around right b/c in your head you know you're traveling south not north. but at the same time, perhaps more helpful in understanding the land.

* if you get lost, should you keep driving until you sort it out, or check your GPS to briefly reorient yourself? not all of us have endless time for this. e.g., on your way to catch a plane, or to an event, or to a meeting.

## Molly's preferences for travel

* the car and its impact on travel -- insulated, protected, deadened to the outside world.

* driving in to capitol hill. kid begs to take train. prefers so much to skateboard a mile. i too prefer train + bike. be in elements more, feel weather, experience hills, direct reality. kid is monkey-barring in train. communal experience with other people. it's a whole more immersive traveling experience compared with the insulation and removal of traveling by bar.

* driving the kids to camp. default routes are the highway, and of course that's not a very exciting route. problem is that no one really knows any better, and it's a lot of work to construct your own routes.

* could be romanticizing this a bit, though. some people ride the train like zombies. i personally like going into the city. i like my multimodal travel. 

* my main problem: route is becoming habit, no longer wayfinding. just automation. caudate nucleus transforms this wayfinding into automation, no longer thinking. not getting any benefit.

* compare spatial orientation with assembling something. requires you to look at a map, see how the pieces fit together, draw pictures in your head. it's kind of hard, uncomfortable. but it feels like it stretches your brain. driving is same way. orienting yourself within a landscape, a place, a context.

## Recapturing a sense of place

* place is important for memory. where did you grow up? where are you from? these are among our first questions for a reason. place matters to our identity. group my life's events by where we lived at the time. when i think about my childhood, place is practically everything.

* i've moved around a lot. so did my dad. from place to place, never really put down roots. think of that song about not moving around too much. place becomes home. 

* Geography of Nowhere. suburbia is devoid of place. car dependent landscapes mean we mostly stay in our houses, watching TV. no sense of community or place anymore. this makes navigation harder. we don't have much of a connection to the land. it's just chain stores and cookie cutter suburban neighborhoods. why should we learn to love our home? Geography of Nowhere -- people move every 5 yrs. no real attachment or rooting in place.

* feel sorry for kids growing up. confined to house like an indoor cat. feel really sorry for this poor cat.

* then again, i live at the foothills of the cascades, one of the most beautiful places on earth. 10 min. driving west and you leave the city and enter rural land. to be so close to the city, water, and mountains is the appeal of this area. i don't venture out nearly as much as i should.

## Relying less on GPS
  
* with the atrophy of our hippocampus, are we losing more than our wayfinding skills? are we losing some memory power, setting ourselves up for cognitive decline? am i atrophying my memory, reducing a sense of place and hence a sense of identity? the key concept is that hippocampus isn't just wayfinding alone but is intertwined with memory skills.

* GPS is one more example of offloading cognitive tasks to the computer. no real sense of where we are in the world, just turn left, right, straight. kind of reducing our orientation in the world. friend routes her way to station every day. it's like a 20 min. city walk.

* by relying less on GPS to guide me, i might strengthen my connection to place.
  
* sometimes the routes make no sense. shave off one minute by taking a totally different route, might be much more difficult (e.g., freeway merging, exiting very quickly, twisting, etc). the idea that we'd be alerted about congestion and reroute is only a slim use case and often you don't know why the route is suggesting what it suggests until you get caught in some congestion due to a crash.

* driving home by avery. no thought about where she's going, just a casual glance at the phone that tells her left, right, straight. total confidence that she knows how to drive and that she knows where she's going. able to focus fully on conversation while not thinking at all about where she's going. not orienting herself in a space in a location. 
   
* psychologically to be at the mercy of the algorithm, to trust that GPS routing knows best and you don't know why it wants you to go a certain way, it just does, is to relinquish your own acumen to that of a computer. does this blend to other aspects of life? we don't know why we do certain things, the algorithm just tells us. and when we disobey, we sometimes suffer consequences (get stuck in congestion). but other times, we find that the route saved 1 minute and took us on some helter-skelter path we'll never remember.

* those moments when you're actually familiar with a route and suddenly question it. why is it recommending this route to save 1 minute, involving freeway merges, corkscrew onramps, ugly scenery, congestion, etc.? the algorithm isn't always the best for the driving experience.

* GPS keeps us confused by constantly switching routes. if you have lots of options and different times of day are slightly more efficient, you sort of never end up learning how to get to places. sad state where no one knows where they are, they just map destinations to places and follow a visual that says turn left, right, etc., always following an egocentric view. 

* want to increase sense of place, identity, peace of mind by increasing navigational certitude. but just memorizing a map and imposing it on the world isn't how people really wayfind. our brain doesn't store a mental map of euclidian geometry onto the world, comparing what we see with that map. wayfinding is more like feeling the land and observing the details to extrapolate conclusions, constant feedback loops of processing input and making observations, and adjusting, etc.

[CONSIDER CUTTING EVERYTHING BELOW HERE. GOES IN ANOTHER DIRECTION AND I'M NOT SURE IT SUPPORTS YOUR ARGUMENT.]
## Over romanticizing wayfinding?

In reading about wayfinding, I sometimes wonder if this skill gets over romanticized. If scientific reasoning, storytelling, and imagination aren't limited to wayfinding tasks but could apply to broader tasks like troubleshooting, bicycle path routing, and assembly instructions, then perhaps giving too much praise to wayfinding skills. The reality is that there's not much of an economic market for environmental wayfinding anymore. All the cultures O'Connor studied (the Inuit, Aboriginal Australians, and Oceania people) seem to be cultures heading toward extinction. Many of the Inuit now use snowmobiles and GPS today, for example, because it's more efficient. 

Consider this scenario. Suppose you hire two truckers to transport goods from the west coast to east coast. One trucker manages to drive the route entirely from memory and wayfinding skill, without a map at all. The other trucker uses a mapping app from the start to end. Both arrive at the same time. While the wayfinding trucker's skills are impressive, it doesn't lead to any economic advantage. They would still be paid the same. Learning wayfinding in some ways feels like the equivalent of doing long division by hand instead of using a calculator. It's cool to be able to do it, but why? 

Outside of wayfinding, the principles of careful observation, scientific analysis, story-building, and so on, are highly relevant to many modern technological contexts. It's much more useful to develop these skills with computers, being able to troubleshoot bugs, solve logistical problems, navigate large projects, structure massive amounts of information in ordered, logical ways, and more. Most certainly, O'Connor's 300 page text with hundreds of cited sources, organized along a careful structure to advance her argument and communicate a sense of awe in the reader, isn't something that anyone can do, including many of the wayfinders (despite their unexplainably impressive skills) she studied. If you were to add up all the decisions one makes in shaping research into story, I'm confident the activity would at least equal if not exceed the brain activity of an animal tracker.

Even if wayfinding skills aren't necessary, and even if the same mentality is available through non-wayfinding activities, I still get a lot of value out of wayfinding. It seems like a worthwhile task, though I've yet to pinpoint exactly why. In the next article, I'll try to identify what other mental modes might be activated when we reject the algorithm telling us to go left or right but instead make decisions for ourselves.
