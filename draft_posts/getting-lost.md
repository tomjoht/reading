title: Getting lost
---

multiple perspectives to compare:

Getting lost in O'Connor wayfinding -- heightened senses

Getting lost in "Never Lost Again" -- the stressful lost, when you need to be somewhere. but also just locating a good place to eat that has high ratings. user comments and annotations on a map is highly valuable. 

most valuable map is the seattle interactive map. comments everywhere.

Getting lost in the Upstream essays by Mary Oliver or something from Avery.

different kinds of lost. get lost as a way to find yourself, perhaps the oldest cliche but also true. many of us are spiritually lost. a lost generation. 

lost in thought. the absent-minded professor. daydreaming about solving math problems or something.

physically lost. being physically lost is perhaps something that might lead to being found? lose your way to find something new?

personal experience: walking around neighborhood and suddenly find a street not familiar. a path through woods. street is much older than more recently built subdivisions. sense of disorientation. i thought i was walking east but road seemed to stretch forever. like entering a time tunnel of sorts. houses/neighbhorhood dated back to my own childhood.

the logic of getting lost: put aside expectations or what your conscious mind thinks you should be doing/feeling and sort of let your inner self emerge. the natural motion. the natural inclination. there was some study about trying to allow for this, unplanned, intuition taking over.
