# From newsletters to book club

It's been a few months since I've added anything to this series, but this absence doesn't meant that I've abandoned it. Instead, I've been mulling over some new strategies, and this is also a long-form experiment that takes time to play out. I'm now ready to describe the most recent segment in this journey.

Initially, I thought that newsletters might be the format that is most commonly used to get your message across in a company. Blogs were practically unheard of in most companies; instead, it felt like newsletters were a commonly accepted content type through which I could create and disseminate content. 

After sending a newsletter that stuffed all content into the email body, I converted our newsletter to a series of blurbs with links pointing to full articles on an internal website (not too unlike the personal blog newsletter I send out). Then I meticulously tracked clicks on the links. I was discouraged to find that newsletter readership was abysmal -- people really weren't clicking the links. I mean, maybe 5-8 people clicked links, out of several hundred recipients.

I decided to pivot the newsletter approach. I felt that my audience was too small, and I needed to expand it to get a more acceptable number of clicks. I modeled my new approach after another internal newsletter that targeted every related product group in a comprehensive way (cutting across multiple groups and org lines). I figured that if I had the same reach, I'd see more clicks and traction.

I was convinced that size would be the needed trigger to see more acceptable metrics. Why? The newsletter distribution for my personal blog includes about 6,500 people. When I send out a newsletter, even if just a few people make comments or other reactions, it seems to make the effort feel worthwhile. Typically, about 100-300 people click the links in the newsletter email. And about 20% open the email in the first place. So overall, there's decent reach. 

And as much as I'd like to simply say I don't care whether people read what I write, that idea doesn't entirely work. Few authors write without any anticipation of being read. It's not that writing is an act of narcissism, where the author aspires to draw attention to him or herself. Instead, I want the validation that what I've written is interesting, compelling, and means something to someone besides myself. If no one reads my posts, it's a good indication that my writing is crap and that I should change my approach. Like a comedian, if no one laughs at your jokes [reads what you write], then maybe your jokes [writing] isn't very good.

To increase my audience reach, and hopefully find the readership I sought, I partnered with two adjacent documentation groups around me and sent out a cross-product area newsletter to a larger audience. How much larger? It's hard to tell. With corporate email lists, there are often groups that include other groups as subscribers, with multiple levels of group nesting. I attempted to track down exactly how many people were included in the new list but lost visibility at some levels, as the nested group's members weren't visible with my permissions. My guess, however, is that the audience included around 1,000 recipients. Probably 3x my previous audience size.

In expanding the audience, it's worth mentioning another difference between internet and corporate newsletters. Within a company, you don't need to ask permission to send people newsletters. You can just target groups with information that you think is relevant to them. It's the expectation that people just receive newsletters from relevant groups. Consequently, though, I'm guessing many view their inbox as a source of spam.

Partnering with the other doc groups to generate the newsletter was tougher than I thought. Not all writers were on board (at first), and they wanted much discussion about the newsletter "plan." I didn't have a solid plan but wanted to keep it loose and experiment. My initial idea was to adopt a systems approach and comment on larger trends and patterns across the developer portal. In the first attempt, I simply wrote the newsletter content myself, identifying common themes across articles published by each group. However, the other writers unanimously told me that what I'd written was way too long. They also said they preferred more of a contributor model where each group provided their input to the newsletter. 

So I scrapped my deep look at emerging patterns approach. I also simplified the contributions to be easier. Instead of looking for higher-level patterns and themes, the new approach involved asking each group to answer these two questions: 

* What are you currently working on?
* What have you recently published? 

Each group kept their content to about 300 words, and I compiled them and sent out the newsletter. It looked pretty good and was more readable, but no one provided any feedback on it, neither as a reply to the email nor in the feedback survey at the bottom of the content. The number of opens was okay (~250), but this number doesn't tell you if the email was open for 1 second or 10 minutes. In my experience, when you don't hear any feedback about something you've published, usually one of the following is true: 

* Almost no one read it
* Those who read it didn't think the content interesting

I started to realize that the newsletter format might be more limiting than I initially thought. I counted up about a dozen other newsletters sent by various groups. It seemed each group wanted push out their own micro-newsletter, informing others that they exist and that they're doing awesome things. I'm guessing our cross-product newsletter was greeted as "yet another newsletter," in the same way that people react when they learn that someone is starting yet another podcast. Do we really need another podcast, seriously? 

I also became more perplexed by what I saw as an impossible situation. The only way to engage an audience, in my view, was to provide more interesting content. This is what I'd attempted to do with my systems view of documentation trends and patterns. I thought if I were clever and insightful enough, people would take notice and readership would take off. But the kind of content meeting that criteria would require far more of an individual voice and content depth than would ever be possible through a collaborative newsletter.

This is an effect I learned when I first started blogging back in 2006. At that time (before idratherbewriting.com existed), I had volunteered as the Suncoast STC chapter webmaster, and I revamped the chapter's website by converting it from Dreamweaver-based HTML to a WordPress site. As I explored WordPress, I tinkered around with the blogging feature and tried to get the chapter to start a group blog. In a chapter of 100+ tech comm professionals, I thought it would be easy to have people contribute an article here and there. 

Nope! The "group" blog was just Tom's posts. Getting others to contribute was like getting your kids to wash the kitchen dishes. After a half dozen or attempts, I realized that this not going to work. The chapter blog was going to be heavily dominated by my own thoughts, not representative of the chapter's voice. So I started my own blog, and I've been writing on it for the past 16 years.

So after sending out this first cross-product-area newsletter, it dawned on me that I was up against the same problem as I'd faced in 2006. Trying to get a group to collaborate in a content project would require a lot of arm twisting, passionate leadership, and project management. And most importantly, there didn't seem to be room for the individual voice. That in-depth article I wanted to write in which I peer across the publishing whole and pull out insights, then expand on them at length? Not really possible. That voice would stick out in an odd, attention-getting way. 

I was stuck. The newsletter content that could represent a documentation group wasn't the sort of content that would engage anyone. The diversity of roles we targeted already cared little about documentation, and now devoid of any voice or interesting perspectives, the newsletter content was destined to fail. 

Without having engaging content, no one would read the newsletter. If no one read the newsletter, why bother to write articles for it? This was a vicious cycle -- the fewer people who read it, the less motivated writers were to contribute. The less effort writers put into contributions, the less engagement it will have with readers. Pretty soon, we (both writers and readers) all throw up our hands and say this isn't worth it. That's the course most newsletters run. 

Nevertheless, I figured that it might be sustainable in a rotational way, such that each person only had to drive it once a quarter. It might have almost no impact, but it did seem worthwhile as a brief visibility blip to those around us, assuming that the effort to produce it was low enough to match the low engagement outcome. At least, I wasn't ready to kill the effort after one sending.

## A new idea

While the newsletter idea waned, I had another idea brewing in the back of my mind. I'd
