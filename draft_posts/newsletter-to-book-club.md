# From newsletters to book club

It's been a few months since I've added anything to this series, but this doesn't meant that I've abandoned it. Instead, I've been mulling over some new strategies. This is also a long-form experiment that takes time to play out.

Initially, I thought that newsletters might be the format that is most commonly used to get your message across in a company. I converted our newsletter to a series of blurbs with links pointing to full articles on an internal website (not too unlike the newsletter I send out). Then I meticulously tracked clicks on the links. I was discouraged to find that newsletter readership was abysmal -- people simply didn't seem to care.

I then decided to pivot the newsletter approach. I decided that my audience was too narrow and I needed to expand it. I modeled my new approach after another internal newsletter that targeted every related product group in a comprehensive way. I figured that if I had the same reach, I'd see more clicks and traction.

I was convinced that size would be the needed trigger to see more acceptable metrics. Why? The newsletter distribution for my personal blog includes about 6,500 people. When I send out a newsletter, if a few people make comments from this number, it makes the effort feel worthwhile. Typically, about 100-300 people click the links in the newsletter email. And about 20% open the email in the first place. So overall, there's enough reach to be considered worthwhile. 

So I partnered with two adjacent documentation groups around me and sent out a cross-product area newsletter with a larger audience. How much larger? It's hard to tell. There are often groups that include other groups as subscribers. I once attempted to track down exactly how many people were included in the new list but lost track. My guess is around 1,100 or so, though. Probably 3x my previous audience size.

I should also note that within a company, you don't need to ask permission to send people newsletters. You can just target groups with information that you think is relevant to them. Consequently, though, I'm guessing many view their inbox as a source of spam.

Partnering with the other doc groups to generate the newsletter was tougher than I thought. Not all writers were on board, and they wanted much discussion about the newsletter "plan." My initial plan was to adopt a systems approach and comment on larger trends and patterns across the developer portal. I attempted to simply write the newsletter content myself, identifying common themes across articles published by each group. However, they almost unanimously told me that what I'd written was way too long. And others preferred more of a contributor model where each group provided their input to the newsletter. 

So I scrapped my deep look at emerging patterns approach and simplified the contributions to be easier. Instead, the new approach involved asking each of the three doc groups to answer these two questions: 

* What are you currently working on?
* What have you recently published? 

Each group kept their content to about 300 words, and I compiled them and sent out the newsletter. It looked pretty good and was more readable, but no one provided any feedback on it, neither as a reply to the email or in the feedback survey at the bottom. The number of opens was okay (~200), but this number doesn't tell you if the email was open for 1 second or 10 minutes. Overall, in my experience, when you don't hear any feedback about something you've published, usually one of the following is true: 

* Almost no one read it
* Those who read it didn't think the content useful or interesting

I also started to realize that the newsletter format might not be worth it. I counted up about a dozen other newsletters sent by various groups. It seems that each group wants push out its own micro-newsletter, informing others that they exist and that they're doing awesome things. I'm guessing that our cross-product newsletter was greeted as "yet another newsletter," in the same way that people react when they learn that someone is starting yet another podcast. Do we really need another one? People have been living just fine without your newsletter or podcast.

I also became more perplexed by what I saw as an impossible situation. The only way to engage an audience was to provide more interesting content. This is what I'd attempted to do with my initial systems view of documentation trends and patterns. I thought that if I were clever and insightful enough, people would take notice and readership would take off. But the kind of content meeting that criteria would require far more of an individual voice than would ever be possible through a collaborative newsletter.

This is an effort I learned when I first started blogging back in 2006. I had volunteered as the Suncoast STC chapter webmaster, and I revamped the chapter's website by converting it from Dreamweaver-based HTML (or something) to a WordPress site. As I explored WordPress, I tinkered around with the blogging feature and tried to get the chapter to start a group blog. In a chapter of 100+ tech comm professionals, I thought it would be easy to have people contribute an article here and there. 

Nope, the "group" blog was mostly just Tom's posts. Getting others to contribute was like getting your kids to wash the kitchen dishes. After a half dozen or attempts, I realized that this not going to work. The chapter blog was going to be heavily dominated by my own thoughts, not representative of the chapter's voice. So I started my own blog, and I've been writing on it for the past 16 years!

So after sending out this first cross-product-area newsletter, it dawned on me that I was up against the same problem as I'd faced in 2006. Trying to get a group to collaborate in a content project would require a lot of arm twisting, direction, and project management. And most importantly, there didn't seem to be room for the individual voice. That in-depth article I wanted to write where I peered across the publishing whole and pulled out insights, then expanded on them at length? Not really possible. That voice would stick out in an odd, attention getting way. 

I was stuck. The content that could represent a documentation group wasn't the sort of content that would engage anyone. And without having engaging content, no one would read the newsletter. If no one read it, why bother to write it? This was a vicious cycle -- the fewer who read it, the less motivated others were to contribute. And the less perceived motivation to contribute, the harder it becomes to project manage and drive contributions. Pretty soon, we all throw up our hands and say this isn't worth it. That's about the course most newsletters run. Nevertheless, I figured that it might be sustainable in a rotational way, such that each person only had to drive it once a quarter. It might have almost no impact, but it did seem worthwhile as a brief visibility beacon to those around us, assuming that the effort to produce it was low enough to match the low outcome.

## A new idea

While the newsletter idea waned, I had another idea brewing in the back of my mind. I'd
