title: Wayfinding post 3

Although the downtown centers near me hold little appeal, I am, in fact, located one of the most beautiful areas in the Northwest. South Seattle might be an unappealing industrial region (with some warehouses and complexes that would make IKEA look small), but southeast King County (Kent, Renton) sits at the edge of the Cascades in a lush, green area filled with tall Fir trees, watersheds, and rolling hills. Drive east for 15 minutes from Kent and you might think you're in another state entirely given the rolling rural landscape.

The other week I needed to drop my 11-year-old off at a week-long summer camp near the Cascade foothills. I first routed to the destination using Google Maps on my computer. The initial route followed along highway 167, which parallels I-5. Two alternates were also proposed. Trying to break out of the pre-programmed lifeless road routes, I decided to travel along a custom scenic route. (Taking the route not optimized for speed is almost never the default.)

If you look at the recommended route, the scenic route takes just 1 minute longer (54 minutes, traveling 33.9 miles versus the speed-optimized route, which takes 53 minutes, traveling 38.7 miles) but of course the scenic route is deprioritized in favor of the faster route (for just 1 minute of time saved!). The recommended route not only saves 1 minute but involves traveling at a faster speed (which means noticing fewer details). If you look at the map, which route looks more enjoyable to drive? Look at all these green areas along the scenic route.

Switching into satellite view gives an even better sense of how green and forest-filled the scenic route is. Pretty much the only thing east of the scenic route is the Cascade mountain range.

I didn't want to use GPS to get to the camp, so I ended up printing off the map. Even traveling this short distance (a one-hour trip) made paper maps problematic. My purchased print map of the area (a GM Johnson City Map) didn't extend into Enumclaw, and I didn't have another map of that area with the needed detail. I tried printing off the route overview but it lacked the scale for the various connection points and turns that I'd need to make. This is one problem with relying on a printed map -- if you drive more than an hour, you exceed the scope of the map. If you get a larger scale map, it doesn't show the needed detail within the areas you're driving. I didn't have a Washington Atlas.

In the end, I took screenshots of the various connection points and referenced them from the larger map, like this:

Albeit tedious, this method also allowed me to study the route a bit more. The drive was, in fact, much more scenic and enjoyable than the time-optimized route along 167. My 15-year-old and 17-year-old are both learning to drive, so I sat in the front passenger seat, fully attentive and alert (even more so than when I'm driving because they're both still novices), and navigated for them while they drove. We stopped in Wilkeson and ate at a small diner called a Simple Goodness Soda Shop that had an interior decor they described as "Americana Mining Town chic."

Modern GPS technology optimizes our route algorithms under the principle that getting to a destination the fastest way possible is the preferred route. There's no setting to adjust for that. Instead, you have to go out of your way to find more scenic routes. Even as my children drove (which can be somewhat terrifying, as they're still new drivers), it was much more peaceful to travel a bit slower and through this lush green area. I developed more of an interest in the towns and scenery. I wanted to know more of the history of places like Buckley, Enumclaw, and Kangley. 

If I really wanted to develop wayfinding skills, the next step would be for me to learn the stories of these places, to maybe make day trips into these areas and be more observant of their city details and environment. In short, to cultivate a sense of topophilia. Topophilia doesn't naturally develop from a beautiful vista or two. Topophilia comes from spending time and having experiences in an area, either by living there or learning from those who do.

At least the paper maps helped me keep focused on the environment. We did get lost briefly, though it only involved a 10 minute detour. I sensed we were off course, checked the GPS to confirm it, and then backtracked to realign with our planned route. I don't think GPS itself is bad, it's relinquishing our own decision-making to the turn-by-turn directions of an algorithm that might be at odds with our goals (like optimizing for speed instead of for place), without thinking about that algorithm or questioning its omniscience.

As we drove, I kept my focus on the area, not on my phone. In other words, I looked up. Some researchers say navigation involves connecting vistas, "traveling along a particular route so as to generate or re-create the temporally structured flow of information that uniquely specifies that path to the destination" (O'Connor, 181). These vistas connect in sequences that mimic the temporal harmony of music. VÃ©ronique Bohbot, author of *The Hippocampus as a Cognitive Map," explains:

> Once you have learned the relationship between landmarks, you can derive a novel route to any destination from any starting position in the environment. Spatial memory is allocentric [outside your own perspective], it's independent of your starting position. You use spatial memory when you can picture the environment in your mind's eye" (qtd in O'Connor, 263). 
 
Some landmarks can help orient me -- a flowing river, for example, or mountains in the distance, especially Mt. Rainier. Distinctive landmarks aren't often visible through a barrier of similar-looking fir trees, though. But by studying out my route, I'd become familiar with the sequence of towns: Maple Valley to Black Diamond, then to Enumclaw, Buckley, Burnette, Wilkeson, and so on. As we drove, road signs often indicated junctions to those connecting towns (this way, rather than looking for the junction to 410 or the switch to the 165, you just followed the sign lead to the next town in the sequence). Rather than natural landmarks, the small towns themselves provided the visual cues about how to navigate without GPS.
