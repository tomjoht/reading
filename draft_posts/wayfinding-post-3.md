title: Wayfinding post 3

reference that article shannon sent you. [article_notes/habitual_use_of_gps.md][article_notes/habitual_use_of_gps.md]

in this, reference Matthew Crawfords Why we drive near the end where he's clearly pushing back against the loss of autonomy in the of increasing technological algorithms taking control. this is the larger theme here. at what point are you controlling the tech versus it controlling you? this is also a theme in Cal Newport's digital minimalism -- you need to be the one in control, using tech to further your own agenda, not the algorithm's agenda.

what is the agenda of a mapping algorithm? does it just want to get you from point A to point B in the fastest possible way? or is there something more nefarious going on, such as routing you past advertisers, or showing you advertisers on a map, or doing something to hijack your attention while a company promotes an idea or brand to influence you? if this is happening, it's pretty subtle. It's not like search engine links where you can clearly see advertising links at the top of your results, and it's easy to see that the attention merchant is selling a bit of your attention to these advertisers in hopes that you click a link or that you become influenced by these ads. The distractions appear clearly flagged as such, and I usually avoid them altogether.

This might beg the question, how do large tech companies from a mapping application? What's in it for them? Well, Google Maps does have advertiser pins (square icons), so that as you browse around on the map, you're bound to see pins like 7-11, Verizon, and KFC appear. Maybe the idea is that by seeing the location of the business, you might decide to include it in your route's plans.

Presumably, it's the ecosystem theory. If you use one app, you're more likely to use another. You do a search online using Google Maps. Then you get in your car and need to route the place you just searched for. Well, if your digital identity seamlessly transitions from one context to another because you're using an ecosystem of apps that all talk to each other and allow that digital identity to seamlessly transition from one context to another, then life becomes more convenient for you. 

I won't explore the ecosystem argument much more except to note that nearly every big tech companies pursues the same strategy. You might buy an Amazon Echo is you're already a Prime member, because your Amazon identity seamlessly authenticates the device and you get notifications about when your shipments arrive. And if you want to buy something from the Amazon marketplace, how much more convenient if you have an Amazon Echo Show to shop. Or if you're watching a show on Amazon Prime Video in your living room and you want to continue watching it in your kitchen, you can tell Alexa to watch it on your Echo Show. And speaking of Alexa, who wants to become familiar with the nuances of multiple digital assistants to interact with technology?


on jacket cover of Never Lost Again, author has self-deprecating quote -- "X has a terrible sense of direction." cute but why? doesn't this say something larger about the futility of the map?

## Effects of GPS on hippocampus
our hippocampus atrophies and we can no longer solve spatial problems. 18

turn by turn directions impact the brain

students are disoriented as to their place in the world. 19


my epiphany: Maybe this explains why following Google Maps doesn't seem to teach us navigation. navigation isn't a mental map -- it's reading the world and being part of it. Our distance and separation from the world makes navigation all but impossible except by false metaphor of the mental map.

Huth teaches course on navigation at Harvard. Students reactions to the course, "This course isn't about navigation but about a mindful way of living and finding our way and ourselves." said another. "To truly understand our surroundings we must immerse ourselves in them," wrote a third. 225 "We get philosophical about it, how knowing where you are helps you know your place in the world... I find it comforting to be orienting myself. ... it forces them to be keenly sensitive to their surroundings. .... The more attuned they are, the more their consciousness seems to expand. In this respect the effect of learning navigation struck me as echoing the discovery of a religious worldview or a transformative life experience: it thins the barriers between ourselves and the world." 225. [various summaries of student' perspectives her]

"Aging people who practice using their spatial memory have a more active hippocampus, a larger hippocampus, and better cognitive health." 267


knowledge is no longer tied to direct experience. 223. Huth and the kayak lifechanging experience.


"...chronic stress, untreated depression, insomnia, and alcohol abuse can all shrink hippocampal volume." 265


"Using Google Maps on one's phone to figure out a route to get somewhere is not dissimilar from using a print map; following turn-by-turn directions to get somehere is an entirely different matter. In the spring of 2017, *Nature Communications* published the result of a study Spiers coauthored that tested twenty-four people using GPS to navigate London's Soho neighborhood. It clearly showed that using a GPS navigation system to get to one's destination essentially switches off distinct parts of the brain, including the hippocampus." 271

'"Our results fit with models in which the hippocampus stimulates journeys on future possible paths while the prefrontal cortext helps us to plan which ones will get to our destination." Spiers talking to reporter. "When we have technology telling us which way to go, however, these parts of the brain simply don't respond to the street network. In that sense our brain has switched off its interest in the streets around us." 272-73

Veronoique Bohbot does not use GPS. While she was careful to point out that no one has yet designed a study to test whether GPS use causes hippocampal atrophy, there is plenty of evidence that following turn-by-turn directions means we are simply not using a spatial strategy to wayfind. In fact, using a GPS is very much like using the response strategy that exercises the caudate nucleus at a cost to the hippocamus. And because of the remarkable plasticity of the brain, not activating and exercising the hippocampus leads to decreased gray matter. Scientists do know that turn-by-turn directions activate the caudate nucleus, and its response strategy bypasses the creation of cognitive maps." 272

 Bohbot talking: "My gut instinct is yes, if people stop using their brains and totally devote themselves to their handheld devices to find their way around the world, that could have a negative effective on getting around the spillover effects on other things like memory." 272

"The crucial difference between the two methods, the researchers argued, was decision-making -- GPS users were not engaged in making decisions." 273

"A couple of years later, researchers at Carleton University conducted a study of 103 individuals and found that using GPS had a number of nefarious consequences for drivers in regard to attention and engagement. Using it replaced direct perception and eliminated the need to gather, integrate, comprehend, and process information from the environment. It also rid drivers of the need for wayfinding, decision-making, and problem-solving." 273



"What good could possibly come from outsourcing cognitive processes that were an essential aspect of making humans human?" 276

LIke the invention of the wheel, car, train, and airplane before us, technologies like the Hyperloop and future commercial space ventures will realign whole economies and patterns of movement. They may also realign the human mind." 278 author says how we distort our sense of time and space, shrinking it. 

"Time--saving it, managing it, maximizing it, escaping it, denying it --strikes me as one of the prime concerns and anxieties of modern life, and hence a metric by which we judge the quality of our travel. How fast is it, how easy to distract ourselves from the means and act of it, the burning of fuel, the people and places we fly over? 'We're not selling transportation, we're selling time,' promises Hyperloop."279-80

"Of course, navigational devices like maps, compasses, and sextants also fit Borgmann's device paradigm, because they outsource to some degree the formidable experience, observation, and memory needed to undertake skilled navigation. But even these inventions required a level of environmental awareness and orientation, as well as an understanding of topography of celestial phenomena. It wasn't until the twentieth century that navigational technology released us from needing to pay *any* [[attention]] at all." 283

"But I see potential for a nefarious influence on our lives: the more we rely on driverless cars and their need for three-dimensional maps, the narrower our choices of where we travel and explore could become. As we grow to depend upon, or maybe even just prefer, autonomous vehicles, they will choose the routes we take, and they in turn will choose those routes that are already mapped. Where we go will increasingly be confined by the technology we use." 283-84

The allure of autonomous vehicles is that so much of our travel along monotonous highways slashed across the landscape, often bordered by sound-insulating walls so as to limit one's view, already feels like a waste of time. If our brains are on autopilot while driving, responding to GPS-simulated instructions, wouldn't it be better to spend that time in some other way? ... I see the driverless car as representing yet another severance between our movement through space and time and the pleasure of effort and autonomy. GPS relieves us of the need to form cognitive maps, and driverless cars relieve us of the need to look away from our screens and take note of directly experienced phenomena in the environment. In seeking maximum speed and ultimate efficiency, the autonomous vehicle cocoons us from the physics of movement at high speeds and the burning of fuel. Rather than plunge us into reality, an autonomous vehicle era."  285-86

"The driver quite literally relies on the virtual representation of the road rather than their unmediated perception of the physical road." 273

Harry Heft, professor of environmental psychology. "The GPS diffuses that whole way of engaging the world ... because you don't even really have to *look* at the world very much." 273

GPS doesn't require you to be observant/aware of your environment. 

"The highway system is so disconnected form the terrain and the topology. I think what GPS does is lead you even further away from that." 274

"Busy, rushed Americans, he [John Stilgoe, landscape historian] thinks so, no longer take the time to explore and discover their surroundings and have lost their capacity to even see them directly. Stilgoee believes that in an age dominated by programmed, medicated material and the internet, the ability to *look* at things, to practice the art of observation that was required of us as a species for eons till now is an essential aspect of our intellect and has to be relearned."  290

"... for someone who prizes exploration as a primary exercise that allows the mind to wander, there could be no more unique capacities in return for mere efficiency. To him, getting lost is an opportunity for discovery, one that demands that all the senses come alive, and creates a maximum alertness in which observation and possibility are heightened. In *What Is Landscape? Stilgoe writes that '[b]eing lost, even being deliberately free of electronic location devices, sharpens one's senses and often eventually reassures." 290

"If I'm lost and I don't have anyone to ask, I love that feeling," he [Joe Stilgo] said, though he drew a distinction between being desperately lost in dangerous circumstances and getting lost in a generally unknown place. In the latter case, to go off track is really about challenging the borders of one's familiarity, pressing beyond the known spaces of our understanding and experiences and into the new." 291-292 

"Part of the problem is parents' incessant management of their children's time. "I think they've missed a kind of self-guided, nonorganized activity, nonsports activity growing up. Wandering around, getting into things. .... most of my colleagues I work with seem to have found their careers by being slightly disorganized. Lucking into something, you know?" Joe Stilgoe. 292-93

children can no longer roam or wander about due to the city roadscape. 292

quoting a study: "Autonomy is a key to the acquisition of spatial skills, therefore the development of these skills can be hindered if children cannot move independently in the outdoor environment." 294

"For Stilgoe, the ubiquity of smartphones can never be a good thing. His career has been dedicated to creating thirst in his students for curiosity, exploration, and wonder ---- believing them to be in fact the keystones of true intellect. Smartphones don't open the user up to their surroundings, they funnel attention into themselves and a universe where everything is known, mapped, and accessible." 294


## My conclusions

probably never develop great wayfinding skills. you think you'll crack the code to wayfinding but then realize that it's not a simple secret. it's knowing the land well enough to feel your way. but i'm no longer beating myself up about this, or thinking that i'm somehow deficient and it's my fault. reasons for lack of wayfinding skills:

* not closely connected with land. travel through mediated experience of car, reducing noise, etc. one reason i liked riding a motorcycle so much was the immersion in an environment, directly experiencing the outdoors. is why i like biking too.
  
* travel too quickly through land. a car moves you much too fast to really notice anything. e.g., traveling 75mph down freeway.

* street navigation doesn't have the same logic as something you might intuit from nature, from wind or wave patterns, or starlight. how do you predict that a certain street route will take you across I-5 from Capitol Hill over to Fremont? still working on logic of what a parkway, blvd, way, court, place, etc. is. sure you can suss out some order in naming patterns, but it's so seemingly random and chaotic.

* i could probably get better at reading roads. names signify intent. is this a road that will go straight or end up fizzling? will it curve around? other cars on it, width of road, stoplights or signs, type of road. does it have sidewalks? power lines? noise level? direction of the flow of most traffic? not sure i ever stop to examine the details. 

* not much point in wayfinding. all cultures the author studies are sort of going extinct. inuit ride snowmobiles and use GPS more. our gain and how you get ahead doesn't rely on wayfinding. more helpful is technical wayfinding, finding your way through a technical issue, being able to solve a problem, understand how to organize a group. seems like that kind of thinking is minimized. author's ability to organize hundreds of sources into a coherent, interesting narrative -- this is an impressive skill, so what if you can't find your way across the land. you aren't an idiot.

## Some positives

* there is a psychological comfort in knowing where you're going, without having to rely on GPS for everything. can focus more fully, scan, anticipate. constantly glancing at a screen while driving really sucks. it's super distracting. kind of anxiety producing and nerve racking. now you must look ahead, behind, at screen, etc. eyes bouncing around. you're more in the moment when you're driving, and the busier the more elements there are on the road, the more important this becomes. just being more focused, more holistically aware, is kind of a big deal. 
  
* GPS has an egocentric orientation that probably isn't all that helpful. some other cultures don't have this egocentric bent in their culture. this is one reason why the directions never really stick -- it's always just left right or straight. but if you turn on allocentric view in maps, it does become confusing. e.g., turn left when you see car bend around right b/c in your head you know you're traveling south not north. but at the same time, perhaps more helpful in understanding the land.

* if you get lost, should you keep driving until you sort it out, or check your GPS to briefly reorient yourself? not all of us have endless time for this. e.g., on your way to catch a plane, or to an event, or to a meeting.

## Molly's preferences for travel

* the car and its impact on travel -- insulated, protected, deadened to the outside world.

* driving in to capitol hill. kid begs to take train. prefers so much to skateboard a mile. i too prefer train + bike. be in elements more, feel weather, experience hills, direct reality. kid is monkey-barring in train. communal experience with other people. it's a whole more immersive traveling experience compared with the insulation and removal of traveling by bar.

* driving the kids to camp. default routes are the highway, and of course that's not a very exciting route. problem is that no one really knows any better, and it's a lot of work to construct your own routes.

* could be romanticizing this a bit, though. some people ride the train like zombies. i personally like going into the city. i like my multimodal travel. 

* my main problem: route is becoming habit, no longer wayfinding. just automation. caudate nucleus transforms this wayfinding into automation, no longer thinking. not getting any benefit.

* compare spatial orientation with assembling something. requires you to look at a map, see how the pieces fit together, draw pictures in your head. it's kind of hard, uncomfortable. but it feels like it stretches your brain. driving is same way. orienting yourself within a landscape, a place, a context.

## Recapturing a sense of place

* place is important for memory. where did you grow up? where are you from? these are among our first questions for a reason. place matters to our identity. group my life's events by where we lived at the time. when i think about my childhood, place is practically everything.

* i've moved around a lot. so did my dad. from place to place, never really put down roots. think of that song about not moving around too much. place becomes home. 

* Geography of Nowhere. suburbia is devoid of place. car dependent landscapes mean we mostly stay in our houses, watching TV. no sense of community or place anymore. this makes navigation harder. we don't have much of a connection to the land. it's just chain stores and cookie cutter suburban neighborhoods. why should we learn to love our home? Geography of Nowhere -- people move every 5 yrs. no real attachment or rooting in place.

* feel sorry for kids growing up. confined to house like an indoor cat. feel really sorry for this poor cat.

* then again, i live at the foothills of the cascades, one of the most beautiful places on earth. 10 min. driving west and you leave the city and enter rural land. to be so close to the city, water, and mountains is the appeal of this area. i don't venture out nearly as much as i should.

## Relying less on GPS
  
* with the atrophy of our hippocampus, are we losing more than our wayfinding skills? are we losing some memory power, setting ourselves up for cognitive decline? am i atrophying my memory, reducing a sense of place and hence a sense of identity? the key concept is that hippocampus isn't just wayfinding alone but is intertwined with memory skills.

* GPS is one more example of offloading cognitive tasks to the computer. no real sense of where we are in the world, just turn left, right, straight. kind of reducing our orientation in the world. friend routes her way to station every day. it's like a 20 min. city walk.

* by relying less on GPS to guide me, i might strengthen my connection to place.
  
* sometimes the routes make no sense. shave off one minute by taking a totally different route, might be much more difficult (e.g., freeway merging, exiting very quickly, twisting, etc). the idea that we'd be alerted about congestion and reroute is only a slim use case and often you don't know why the route is suggesting what it suggests until you get caught in some congestion due to a crash.

* driving home by avery. no thought about where she's going, just a casual glance at the phone that tells her left, right, straight. total confidence that she knows how to drive and that she knows where she's going. able to focus fully on conversation while not thinking at all about where she's going. not orienting herself in a space in a location. 
   
* psychologically to be at the mercy of the algorithm, to trust that GPS routing knows best and you don't know why it wants you to go a certain way, it just does, is to relinquish your own acumen to that of a computer. does this blend to other aspects of life? we don't know why we do certain things, the algorithm just tells us. and when we disobey, we sometimes suffer consequences (get stuck in congestion). but other times, we find that the route saved 1 minute and took us on some helter-skelter path we'll never remember.

* those moments when you're actually familiar with a route and suddenly question it. why is it recommending this route to save 1 minute, involving freeway merges, corkscrew onramps, ugly scenery, congestion, etc.? the algorithm isn't always the best for the driving experience.

* GPS keeps us confused by constantly switching routes. if you have lots of options and different times of day are slightly more efficient, you sort of never end up learning how to get to places. sad state where no one knows where they are, they just map destinations to places and follow a visual that says turn left, right, etc., always following an egocentric view. 

* want to increase sense of place, identity, peace of mind by increasing navigational certitude. but just memorizing a map and imposing it on the world isn't how people really wayfind. our brain doesn't store a mental map of euclidian geometry onto the world, comparing what we see with that map. wayfinding is more like feeling the land and observing the details to extrapolate conclusions, constant feedback loops of processing input and making observations, and adjusting, etc.
