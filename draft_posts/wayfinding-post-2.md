title: Wayfinding requires you to be present in the world
---

The foundation of wayfinding involves a mindset of "being present" with the world around you. You have to pay close attention to the environment you're interacting with. O'Connor says, navigation "start[s] with practicing acute observation of the places you already live" (298). As she interacted with various wayfinding cultures -- the Inuit, Oceania, Aboriginal Australians -- and with wayfinding experts who study neuroscience and psychology, she asked people for tips on learning wayfinding and navigation. "Again and again, I was surprised by how simple the answers were," she says. "Learn to draw," said one professor, who continued: "We don't know how to represent the world well enough. Actually paying attention to the environment, making empirical observations and organizing them into a system -- do that" (298).

The first principle of wayfinding, then, is to be attentive to the world around you -- so much that you could draw it. You have to be in the world, taking in the full sensory experience, not just the visual landscape, but the topography (inclines, declines), the wind patterns, the light, its history, and basically every detail you can observe and feel. 

Being in the world requires that you mediate the world directly rather than by way of a screen. O'Connor says, "...wayfinding is an activity that confronts us with the marvelous fact of being in the world, requiring us to look up and take notice, to cognitively and emotionally interact with our surroundings whether we are in the wilderness or a city, even calling us to renew our species' love affair with freedom, exploration, and place" (10).

Part of the reason I like interacting with maps so much, as I sit on my computer, is because these maps represent a form of what's out there, in the real world. By looking at places and planning routes, forays to different places, I feel the exhilaration of knowing that, eventually, I'll no longer be sitting i this computer chair looking at the flat screen of a virtual world but will be physically out in the real world, feeling the sun or rain or looking at gray clouds as I move about on foot, on bike, or use some other mode of travel in the real world.

Unfortunately, even when we go out into the world, modern life erects barriers between us and the world. To get from place to place, we get into our cars and shut the door on the world. The sound outside quiets, we adjust the temperature of our artificial environment, turn up the radio, and then move forward without any physical exertion at all. Insulated from the raw experience of the environment, we accelerate across cement landscapes in our own private space, protected from interacting with others except as other car forms. Is it any wonder that, as we cut ourselves off from the experience of the world, our wayfinding skills suffer?

One of the Inuit people O'Connor interviewed said, "Being out on the land lifts you up spiritually, emotionally, and physically. It gives you medication, or meditation, however you want to call it" (36). As someone who spends most of his life working in tech, I feel a longing for more connection with the land, to be outside.

When I am out in the world, I'm often traveling from one place to another, such as from home to work, or running errands. The car as a mode of travel not only insulates us from a more direct experience with the environment, it travels too quickly for us to take in details (225). "In a car when you travel, you miss a lot of country, a lot of stories," says one of the Aboriginal Australians O'Connor interviewed (193). John MacDonald, an Inuit researcher, says, "The faster you traverse the land, the less observant of it you become" (78). Speed has an inverse relationship with the details you take in -- the faster the speed, the less detail. 

As we drive along roads at 65 mph or more, it's hard to notice much of anything (160). Further, because many of the roads we take follow the fastest route, there's less to look at because the landscape along thoroughfares is generally more lifeless and banal than more scenic, leisurely routes. Driving down an interstate highway is an activity that induces hypnosis.

In this way, the modern modes of travel are at odds with developing skills of wayfinding. Wayfinding experts say to be super observant of the surrounding landscape, but our modern modes of travel (driving a car, following efficient GPS routes zipping along highways and thoroughfares) strip the landscape of interest and detail. Our minds tune out the surrounding areas and we focus instead on the radio or podcasts as a way to bide the time until we reach our destination. And yet, in many of the cultures O'Connor studied, the journey was part of the reason for the trip. One group in Oceania seemed to go on a long sailing trip to a distant island to acquire some small grocery item, not for the item, but for the opportunity to sail across the water.

Sailing across ocean blue water is one thing, but driving across town in rush hour is quite another. In *The Geography of Nowhere: The Rise and Decline of America's Man-Made Landscape*, James Kunstler argues that the man-made landscape often becomes a car-optimized cementscape that loses all appeal for people to interact in. Kunstler describes the appeal of walking through car-dependent infrastructures in suburban areas as follows:

> Here there is no pretense of being in a place for pedestrians. The motorist is in sole possession of the road. No cars are parked along the edge of the road to act as a buffer because they would clutter up a lane that might otherwise by used by moving traffic, and anyway, each business has its own individual parking lagoon. Each lagoon has a curb cut, or two, which behaves in practice like an intersection, with cars entering and leaving at a right angle to the stream of traffic, greatly increasing the possibility of trouble. There are no sidewalks out here along the collector road for many of the same reasons as back in the housing development--too expensive, and who will maintain them?--plus the assumption that nobody in their right mind would ever come here on foot.
> 
> Of course, one could scarcely conceive of an environment more hostile to pedestrians. It is a terrible place to be, offering no sensual or spiritual rewards. In fact, the overall ambience is one of assault on the senses. No one who could avoid it would *want* to be on foot on a typical collector road. Any adult between eighteen and sixty-five walking along one would instantly fall under the suspicion of being less than a good citizen. (116-117)

Kunstler's book, written in 1993, couldn't more accurately describe the suburbia where I live (Kent/Renton). It's not a place where one walks. You drive everywhere. The walk score of my area is 10 (out of 100). If you do have to walk somewhere commercial, it's usually an unpleasant experience, treading on hot sidewalks beside busy roads with cars flying by at 45mph. When I see other pedestrians here, my first thought is usually, are they homeless? Are they stranded? Why is this person walking here?

In such suburban, car-dependent areas, can one develop an interest in th place? Can you ever develop the emotional attachment necessary to become a close observer of the land in a way that would yield more natural wayfinding abilities? Immersion in the cement infrastructure doesn't uplift you spiritually, connect you with stories from your past, or invite you to explore its rich detail with a fully present mind. It's more of a landscape where you want to get from point A to point B in the fastest way possible. It's little wonder that we've lost interesting in wayfinding. 

In *Walkable City: How Downtown Can Save America, One Step at a Time*, Jeff Speck, an urban planner, argues that a city's vitality and interest depends on its walkability. Thanks to city engineers and the prioritization of traffic flow, cities have largely been reshaped around the needs of the automobile, with wider streets and faster speeds along those streets. The prioritization of cars in cities "have turned our downtowns into places that are easy to get to but nor worth arriving at." 

For downtowns to be walkable, Speck says "a walk has to satisfy four main conditions: it must be useful, safe, comfortable, and interesting." *Useful* means you can get common household items. *Safe* means protected from cars hitting you. *Comfortable* means that many of the streets resemble "outdoor living rooms." And "*Interesting* means that sidewalks are lined with unique buildings with friendly faces and that signs of humanity abound." The less that walking satisfies these conditions, the less we walk.

I've only experienced a few actual urban hubs that satisfy these conditions. Walking down Broadway in New York, for example, or walking along Capitol Hill's Broadway street in Seattle, or walking in the financial district in San Francisco. These urban streets take on interest through the many unique shops and people in these spaces.

Most downtown areas near to where I've lived, however, such as downtown Renton or downtown Tacoma, align with Kunstler's and Speck's depiction of a city landscape that has been reshaped to accommodate cars and where walking is the anomaly. It would be hard to develop a connection with these places.

## Affinity for a place

Paying close attention to the land requires some affinity for the place you're in. If you have deep connections culturally, historically, and religiously to the land, you're more apt to take in those details and remember them. O'Connor uses the term *topophilia* to describe this "the sense of attachment and love for place" (296). If you establish a connection to the land, you'll be more likely to carefully observe its details. "If you're paying attention and listen, often there is a whole other story, telling us where we are," explained one of the Oceania people, talking about sailing (245). You can't see that hidden story unless you slow down and absorb the details of an area.

O'Connor says that to develop topophilia, we have to accumulate treasure maps of memories: "Across cultures, navigation is influenced by particular environmental conditions -- snow, sand, water, wind -- and topographies -- mountain, valley, river, ocean, and desert," O'Connor says. "But in all of them, it is also a means by which individuals develop a sense of attachment and feeling for places. Navigating becomes a way of knowing, familiarity, and fondness. It is how you can fall in love with a mountain or a forest. Wayfinding is how we accumulate treasure maps of exquisite memories" (297). 

Not just maps, but *treasure maps*. To develop an affinity for a place, you have to learn its history and stories -- its treasures. In the United States, we move from place to place every five to seven years, whether for job opportunities or other circumstances (or just boredom). As such, it's hard to know an area beyond a superficial level. How do we move from superficial maps to treasure maps? 

A place doesn't have to be spectacular to be a treasure map. Our sense of place as a home usually has deep roots with our psyche. Think about why one of the first questions we ask each other is "Where are you from?" Why does place matter so much? Where we grew up is much more than just logistical. Places reference our homes. Homes shape our identity. So how does a place become your home? 

For O'Connor, her home "was the small, scrappy chicken farm that [she] had loved so much and so briefly as a child" (304), a place that "shaped [her] like clay" (305). I grew up in a small town in a dairy valley (Burlington, Washington), and like O'Connor, I can also still trace out the map of my childhood's neighborhood (the slough in the back along a dirt trail, the roads up to the central park with its baseball fields and dirt mounds for biking, the long gravel roads along the dike out to the Skagit River and its sandy/dirty shoreline, the dirt farm fields where I rode around on my motorcycle). 

And yet, if a stranger were to drive through Burlington, this area would be entirely unmemorable. It looks like just a small town whose economic livelihood is waning and where people live in 75-year-old homes that haven't changed much with the passage of time. But for me, the map is my treasure map.
