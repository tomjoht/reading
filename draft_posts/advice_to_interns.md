## Talk to interns

"I thought it could be interesting for you to offer your own perspective and advice to those who are earlier in their career."

could focus on various points, or just a few.

be proactive.

the intangibles of driving a document through a process.

being bold?

all those things they list as qualifications for the position. do they actually matter?

read more? write more?

using writing as a tool for discovery?

personal mastery? purpose, vision?

maybe list 5 myths

- have to be really technical?
- people will review things outside of meetings.
- nothing is real until it has a deadline.
- work through partner engineers?

how to have focus in your career? maybe talk a little bit about that. how do you learn to read again? maybe talk about how learning to focus in an age of distraction is something they'll have to deal with. people don't read anymore.

everyone starts out as a technical writer and then eventually in your career, you specialize in something. you might not know what that specialization is. but here are some sub-specialization areas in the tech comm field:

* API documentation, developer documentation
* Developer portals
* Style guides
* Tools
* Usability
* eLearning
* Management
* Intelligent Content
* Consulting
* Content management systems
* xPA collaboration

Need to identify what area you want to specialize in. 
When i was starting out, i didn't realize that this was a thing. talk by jack molisani on the hybrid relationship to your career.

personal mastery and being driven with some sense of purpose. what's that inner sense of a goal that is driving you? take a note from senge's book. what is it about the field that ignites an interest in you, that could form part of that sense of inner purpose? because without it, chances are you'll find the career boring and will transition to something else.

more than anything, what's important is to connect your work with something that you're passionate about. that long-term motivation is key. without, work becomes drudgery.

what is it about tech comm work that fascinates you? i guess i really like writing, caught this bug early. see writing as a tool for thinking. focus of my blog is that it's been about tech comm, but really the medium is the message. i'm a reflective practitioner. i'm embody professional curiosity and continual learning. topic could have been about anything.

what is it for you that you find interesting about the work? unlocking something complicated. solving the puzzle.

superpowers to leverage: your ability to read. 

some practical advice to impart:
- technical expertise is overrated. focus on your ability to get information from engineers and push documents over the finish line. 
- set up meetings that include time for people to read the docs you want them to review.
- print things out that you want to read. then actually read. build a habit of reading.
- learn to focus by muting things that distract you. tech companies are attention merchants. but if you can't focus, you won't achieve much of anything.
- use writing as a tool for discovery. greatest thing about writing is that it allows you to see what you think, ask questions, use it as an interlocutor for your own thoughts. spurs innovative thinking, unlocks things.

## latest thoughts

practical advice:

1. learn to focus. coming up in age of distraction. easy to get fragmented into many different channels.

2. writing is a tool for influence, if you want it to be.

3. find something to specialize in in the field.

## thoughts as of August 2

focus entirely on the young angle.

reason why most software engineers are young. certain amount of risk inherent in a startup, younger people more willing to take risks.

that section in Senge's book on the benefits of being young.

unpack the pablo picasso quote: it takes a long time to be young.

so my message to them is to first recognize what they have, and then to try to keep that throughout their attitudes. work experience isn't about gaining something that you lack; it's about keeping what you already have in spite of everything that's going to happen.

what will happen in their careers that will make them more cynical and jaded?

- the fake deadline where you spend all weekend working only to realize that the deadline was arbitrary
- the excitement about a new product release that will change the world b/c it makes it so easy to publish, then no one uses it, total flop.
- running into defensive attitudes across boundary lines, other people in product areas who publish on your dev portal who don't want to play nicely
- the developer who says no one reads the docs and so trivializes your role
- the PM who doesn't review your docs b/c they're too busy, giving all their time and attention to engineering concerns
- the sense that you're working on documentation for a product that you think it's needed in the world, which will only enrich the company but not solve any meaningful problems
- the way support groups create KB articles or respond to user questions in ways that would merit some documentation but never reach out to you
- the way OKRs fail to cascade up in ways that connect to a larger, more coherent strategy in an organization
- the way teams will ignore a CL until the last minute and then expect you to work heads-down on the docs. or how they develop road maps that will surely involve doc work but don't tell you until 2 weeks before they need it, expecting you to work heads down on it
- the way inflation outpaces the annual merit increases of your salary, and how after 4 yrs, the incentives to be at the company fizzle
- the fact that the only way to climb the salary ladder is by moving into management or by performing miracles, but to job hop across companies is much easier and allows you to quickly improve your salary without doing a whole lot more
- the frequent reorgs that seem to do nothing, a CEO who simply wants to rebalance the deck in the appearance of making meaningful change but without any follow through to measure results of effectiveness of the reorg, and doing little communicate reasons why or even what the reorg is
- coming into the office to find that half of your colleagues are gone due to rebalancing of the company. 
- getting laid off from a company.

Amplify those skills you have:

- experimentation. try new things. see what works. it keeps the career young. my philosophy of writing is that it's half experience mixed with research that makes for good post. trying new things keeps your mind open, makes you realize that there might be better or alternative ways of doing things.
- don't just wait to be assigned things. be proactive. no one likes to handhold interns, giving you tasks that you things you can do. mgmt of an intern consumes about 30% of your time. this is why i actually never want to manage an intern. my experience in my career of mging an intern was to never know if i was giving her too much work or too little. like, do you need more? 
- figuring out what the work is is work itself. people wait for tasks assigned, this is my pet peeve. you should know how to figure out what work is needed:
  - identify the product teams you support
  - look at upcoming roadmaps for those teams. identify needed doc work.
  - look at support logs to see where partners are getting stuck.
  - talk with partner engineers to identify friction points.
  - look at analytics.
  - hold regular sync meetings with product teams to scope work.
  - recognize that work comes from different sources: product teams, partner engineers, support tickets.
  - there's also an internal measure of evaluating the docs yourself.
  - also, don't just focus only on the docs you own. adopt a systems thinking perspective. look at the whole. so many of us are focused myopically. this isn't the user experience.


how can you avoid this hardening?
- mental models. be aware of this. what stories do you begin to tell yourself about the profession and career.



leverage 2 superpowers:

* reading. print stuff out. regain your long-form concentration. no one reads anymore. if you do, you can learn how to learn.
* write and share. you can influence this way. takes time but is the formula for influence. tremendous power. share meeting notes.
