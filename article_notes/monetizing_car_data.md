The Mckinsey & Company report suggests that many drivers are willing to share their data for some benefits. In [Monetizing car data: New service business opportunities](https://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/mckinsey/industries/automotive%20and%20assembly/our%20insights/monetizing%20car%20data/monetizing-car-data.ashx), the authors explain, "Consumers understand they will share personal information as part of their digital lives &mdash; they just expect to get a fair value in return." The type of [[data]] consumers are more willing to share varies, but "At the low-sensitivity end, external environment conditions, the vehicle's technical status, and vehicle usage are the data categories in which consumers are most willing to share information. This is perceived to be â€˜objective' data and generally less critical" (16).

So drivers seem open to sharing information that they feel will ultimately come back to benefit them &mdash; information about the road, their car's status, how they're using the car, etc. Sharing this information is a type of economic bartering &mdash; producers and consumers arriving at an exchange of _goods_ [information] acceptable to both.
