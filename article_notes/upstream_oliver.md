Mary remembers a time during her youth when she was [[lost]] but really just entranced by the outdoors as she followed a river upstream. She was walking upstream instead of downstream. "If this was lost, let us be lost always." (5)

I didn’t choose them, I don’t fault them, but it took time to reject them. Now in the spring I kneel, I put my face into the packets of violets, the dampness, the freshness, the sense of ever-ness.

May I look down upon the windflower and the bull thistle and the coreopsis with the greatest respect.” (7)
