mom obituary

- born in Kansas City, Kansas on Feb 1, 1938, daughter of Ruth Abbuel and Edwin Schalker. Siblings: David and Arnie. The Abbuels came over from Bern, Switzerland, and build cheese factories in Kansas. (See the History of Half Mound book for a full history of this.) at age 4, moved to Holton after father Edwin died (b/c mother moved back to parent's house in Holton). 
- Edwin died at age 42 of colon cancer. was sick 1.5 yrs before death. mom was 4 at time. doesn't remember her father. is curious to know how he was with the children. never asked her older brother arnie who was 11 or 12 at the time (arnie later committed suicide). Edwin was in WWI. either he lied to enter army early or ancestral records are wrong. he was in the army around 1899. Ruth was born in 1897. Military has his records.
- Ruth lost her brother Ross of neck cancer around the same time her husband died, and also lost her mother-in-law Mary Kellerman/Schalker (Keiser?) who died around 1942. So Ruth had 3 deaths: husband, mother-in-law, and brother in six months of each other. there were hard feelings between Lydia (Edwin's sister) and Ruth because Lydia's sister changed the will of her mother when Mary Schalker died. Lydia propped her mother up and changed her will, did not leave anything to Ruth, which was her mother's intent. Ruth fought this in court but lost. it was a significant amount of money and personal things. Lydia was sister of Edwin Abbuel. Lydia changed Mary Schalker's will. 
- before marriage, Ruth Abbuel worked as high school teacher teaching english and journalism for 5 yrs. it was against the law for woman to work (or just teach) and be married. so after getting married to Edwin Schalker, she quit her job. Edwin wanted to be a baker, went to school to learn how to bake bread. But there wasn't good money or prospects in this, or the bakery school went asunder(?), so he became a lawyer instead. he was the town prosecutor. he was running to be judge when he found out he had colon cancer, so he withdrew from the contest for judge. 
- After Arnie died, Ruth moved back in with her parents. This was a big white house next to an Episcopalian (later Methodist) church. Ruth played the organ and piano. She also had a strong knowledge of the bible. She was well educated, articulate, and participated in many of the societies. She studied to get an elementary school teaching degree (?)then taught elementary school because Marian at the time was entering high school and Ruth didn't want to be a teacher while Marian was a student.
- Marian studied occupational therapy as an undergraduate at the University of Kansas. It was a new program and field at the time, and they were still figuring out what college to put it -- they initially put OT into fine arts because it involved hands-on technical skills. 
- After completing the OT program, Marian worked for a year in Kansas (at Minora Medical Center, a Jewish center) but then moved out to San Diego for work. She worked there for 5 years. worked with developmentally disabled children. 
- During her time in San Diego, she was involved in a Unitarian church and met David Johnson through a Unitarian fellowship program. David had recently returned from the Air Force and was studying at the University of San Diego (subject?). they got married in the park.
- David decided to go to graduate school at the UW in the English lit program there. Marian quit job and joined him and they moved to Kirkland, Washington. David spent 6 years there going to school, also working as a teaching assistant, while Marian worked as an OT in the area. worked in rehab depart at UW teaching beginning OT students as an instructor. after 6 yrs, either had to work toward masters, but she wanted to get married. there's a point where you have to decide on your path. left program in june, was pregnant, had lizzy in july in burlington.
- why burlington? there was a tavern for sale. they used cash from the sale of their house in kirkland. they sold the house for less than they could have asked for.
- David was entering the dissertation part of the program when they found out Marian was pregnant. He decided to abandon the lit program, and they moved to Burlington and he bought a tavern (with what money?). 
- Marian was david johnson's meal ticket, Marian worked while David went to school and he drunk. she feels like she was vulnerable, not aggressive enough.
- worked for a while part time in OT after bearing liz, tom, but not many job opportunities in burlington, nor in kansas. 

- David's drinking habits intensified into alcoholism. Marian believes alcoholism interfered with David's ability to finish the program at UW. He should have been able to get a PhD during that time and finish the program, but he was probably derailed through alcohol. She's not sure what he was doing with all the time there. 
- David's own father was an alcoholic, with a brother who was deaf. They bounced around a lot growing up, with his father not able to stay employed for too long as a mechanic and also looking for better deaf schools or therapy for Henry (aka Buster). David always wondered how Marian could take a sip of wine and stop but he couldn't -- he'd just continue drinking. 
- Marian felt David had tremendous writing skills. She would help him type his papers. She says he could draft them in a single setting and they were good without any revision -- he would get As or A-'s. She felt he had much more potential in life but was held back by alcoholism. 
- Even though David was an alcoholic, he loved Tommy and Lizzy, his children, dearly. Sometimes he would come home drunk and would wake us up to play with us. Marian always emphasized how much David loved us, despite the alcoholism.
- The alcoholism got so bad, one day Marian took the children and moved back to Kansas with her mother. She told David that unless he sobered up, he would no longer see his children. 
- every few years would go back to visit. thought about moving to kansas permanently. 
- David joined AA and actually sobered up. He loved his children so much he chose them over the bottle. His first year of sobriety stuck, and he never relapsed. However, he was often angry and short-tempered, like a dry drunk, especially in the early years of sobriety, so he was hard to live with.
- not many work opps with children in burlington, worked in corn factory and as postal worker. somewhere around that time she got a divorce. moved to tacoma, tried to sell insurance, not a closer. then found a job as an OT, part-time. then worked at state mental institution. i was around 16. introduced me and liz to colleagues, walked down locked wards. we shared a car. white honda prelude.
- hitting the cyclist, was nice to me b/c of ESAR. no charge. i wasn't in a hurry to get my license, was more patient.
- worked in psych center in tacoma, not much work for her, not much pay, but there was lots more work in florida working in nursing homes. moved to florida for opportunity to earn more, more influx, higher demand for therapy. got a lot more money, started working in 1994, got a lot more money working in nursing homes than she did in WA State. worked from Novacare from 1994 to 1999. then worked in the schools in oscaloosa school district, by fort walton beach near panhandle. worked from 1999/2000 until retiring in 2007, then moved back to Tampa to be near Liz in retirement, bought Condo in 2007. novacare job was a good move. stayed home one year, but then returned to work 3 more years, had more energy, wanted to work and get more money. then retired again in 2011.
- David never seemed to live up to his potential (at least what Marian saw in him long ago in San Diego). He worked as a safety officer at Portal and later the Dept of Ecology, doing government work. Marian continued working as an occupational therapist.
- Marian's brother David Schalker, a psychiatrist living in Minnesota, had renal failure and needed a kidney. Marian donated her kidney to him, and he lived for another 25 years before the kidney gave out. David's wife Karla and Marian would be good, lifelong friends.
- Marian and David divorced in 1985. Due to work opportunities, several years later, Marian moved to Tacoma while David continued in Burlington. Marian at times worked two jobs (?) selling insurance while also working as an OT.
- Liz joined Marian in Tacoma, and then 2 years later (?) Tom as well. 
- In 1994, Marian moved to Clearwater Beach, Florida (why? work?), due to better work opportunities, and Liz joined her. In Florida, Liz worked as a successful graphic artist after college (finish undergrad degree?). Tom went to BYU and then on a mission in Venezuela, having joined the Mormon church. He spent a month in Clearwater Beach before and after his mission with Marian, then returned to BYU.
- Marian's OT job ended in Clearwater Beach (her employer, Novacare, changed focus). So worked up in Tarpon Springs, Newport Richey (?), and then later northern Florida (?)before eventually retiring. She lived near Liz for the remainder of her life, enjoying her grandchildren and pets. 
- Her greatest focus in life was her two children Liz and Tom. 
- 
- 
- worked initially as lifeguard, also teaching swimming lessons to young children, then teaching adults to swim. 50 cents an hour. then worked as soda jerk in drug store. kids would stop by after school and get sodas, she would also help them find items in the drug store.
- in holton, one black family not allowed in pool. remembers being 
- in divorce, marian never received money, didn't ask for it either, not even child support, yet she carried the brunt of the responsibility for the children.
- purchase of tavern, david couldn't manage especially being alcoholic, filed for bankruptcy. mom married an alcoholic, she didn't know. she grew up in non-drinking family. she thought his drinking was social, related to campus activities, drinking/partying at campus. only realized extent of alcohol drinking was more than that. said coming home, she put dinner in oven, but he was out drinking. he never had accident or stopped by police. mom one time went into Al Anon for those whose spouses or friends drink (those affected by alcoholism), she said i think i married an alcoholic, and they said, honey, we all did.
- sobered up for 30 years of his life after being confronted with marian's moving to Kansas with children. he had so much more talent that he never used, writing was one. had one job interview in Mississipi for teaching position but b/c no PhD, no job. mom was his mealticket while he was going to class for 6 years. he had masters, all but dissertion. alcohol got in the way. lots of regrets but got 2 kids out of it.
- liz came to see mom every day in nursing home/hospital for like 100 days! you can't teach kids these things. they either have it or not, more natural for women to be caregivers.
- moving from kirkland, concerned about raising kids in a city. would have been better to stay there.

- Arnold John Schalker, lived in Leavenworth kansas. died of pneumonia when Edwin, his son, was 12 years old. In leavenworth, there's a bakery called Schalker Bakery, painted on the side of bricks. that's where Mary Kellerman (Mary Johann Keiser?). Mary Kellerman took over the bakery and was baking breads and pastries, they lived above the bakery. 
- Lydia Schalker married a Kellerman. 
- mom's first car is mercury comet.


- mom's grandpa died when she was 8. heartwrenching. brothers die. repeating patterns of male failure. grandpa becomes surrogate father. grandpa's name? henry? he was big and happy and they read newspapers together and would crack walnuts together, old fashioned walnuts, cracking them. he had a stroke and then died when mom was 8. he was a county treasurer of some kind.
- liz lived in trailer with dad, mom had gone to tacoma for a year. liz lived with rita and dad. i must have lived there too. liz went through entire year at burlington edison. mom in tacoma, was done living with dad. rita's kids hadn't arrived yet, arturo. i lived there in 7th and 8th grade. high school in UP was 10-12, so when Liz left, she became freshman again. i stayed through k-8th to finish elementary school. dad's girlfriend jill before rita.

- liz sees defining patterns of male failure, men taking care of mom as littlest girl in family, saw dad as potentially person to do that and discouraged when didn't work out that way.
- dad didn't want mom to divorce her. wanted mom to change. mom was emotionally checked out long ago, dad said she wouldn't come back to her, wouldn't be the emotional wife or something.
- mom has mental models of the world's events, driving around in her head, explaining how she was used as a mealticket. bitterness grows. no sympathy for the alcoholism. lesson to learn: be aware of the mental models we have of things. might be different to see things from another point of view. what is this other person's mental model of the world? take the time to understand their mental model and you might not have such a negative view of things.
- seems like every man in mom's life has died early or been a failure, which is why she celebrates our success so much.
- it's hard to accept another person's difference as a valid other.
