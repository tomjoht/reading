## questions the author has
"What happens when we outsource navigation to a gadget?" 5
what exactly is it that humans are doing when we navigate? how and why do we do it differently from birds, bees, and whales? HOw has the speed and convenience of technology changed how we move through the world and how we see our place in it?  6
what if Gps is a gadget that addresses a specific set of cultural conditions: a severance of the individual from direct experience and generational knowledge of a place? 14

what is wayfinding? "the use and organization of sensory information from the environment to guide us." 16 "quoting reginald golledge, " the ability to determine a route, learn it, and retrace or reverse it from memory through the acquisition of environmental knowledge." 16

gps severs us from direct experience. gps doesn't require us to remember.

author's main point:

wayfinding is about experiencing the land. 

getting lost -- heightened senses, new way of seeing, much more alert about surroundings

by using GPS, we lose awareness of surroundings, become non-observant. distracted and focused elsewhere.

turn by turn directions impact the brain

our hippocampus atrophies and we can no longer solve spatial problems. 18

students are disoriented as to their place in the world. 19

capitalism and time lost during transit 19. speed is optimized b/c the traveler doesn't sense any value in the time spent traveling.

"...wayfinding is an activity that confronts us with the marvelous fact of being in the world, requiring us to look up and take notice, to cognitively and emotionally  interact with our surroundings whether we are in the wilderness or a city, even calling us to renew our species' love affair with freedom, exploration, and place." 10

navigation and memory are tied together. 36
interacting with the land rejuvenates and invigorates your spirit. 36

my thoughts: 
- wayfinding is not too unlike how a programmer might feel his or her way through a problem. looking at error messages, simplifying the problem to isolate the error, and generally piecing together the solution. the wayfinder in a natural environment does this to suss out environment cues. so it's not like we've become Walle-like potatoes. we just focus in other areas.
- the reality is that there's not much of an economic place for wayfinding. the person who can solve computer problems makes a much better use of his or her mind than the person who can wayfind without a map. the reality is that all the groups Connor profiles are on the decline, their expertise on the verge of extinction. wayfinding is becoming a lost skill that is on its way out.
