Why did I start reading this book?

* in my experiment to get rid of smartphone, this was supposed to be an app you can't live without. read some initial studies about london cabbies and hippocampus effects

* noticed some interesting initial effects in navigating without gps. more of a confidence. piqued my interest.

* always had a bad sense of direction without understanding why. was there some secret to navigation?

* a nagging sense that the egocentric model of wayfinding with google maps was problematic in that although i seemed to frequently use these apps, they didn't help my sense of direction at all. some kind of paradox.

* Lived in Renton a year but still was routing everywhere. ridiculous. places i'd been to many, many times.


## Authors main argument

wayfinding isn't just a matter of imposing a mental map in your head on the surroundings. it's more complicated, like following a song, or connecting visual points.

wayfinders are deeply connected with their land. direct experience on the land leads to more careful observations and attentiveness. 

wayfinding is closely tied to memory in your hippocampus. some way wayfinding is first scientific mode of thinking, as you put together clues to extrapolate larger judgments.

she looks at several cultures: oceania/pacific, arctic, aboriginee. in each of these cultures, wayfinding is becoming a lost art. no real place for a navigator in today's economy.




## My conclusions

probably never develop great wayfinding skills. but i'm no longer beating myself up about this, or thinking that i'm somehow deficient and it's my fault. reasons for lack of wayfinding skills:

* not closely connected with land. travel through mediated experience of car, reducing noise, etc. one reason i liked riding a motorcycle so much was the immersion in an environment, directly experiencing the outdoors. is why i like biking too.
* travel too quickly through land. a car moves you much too fast to really notice anything. e.g., traveling 75mph down freeway.
* street navigation doesn't have the same logic as something you might intuit from nature, from wind or wave patterns, or starlight. how do you predict that a certain street route will take you across I-5 from Capitol Hill over to Fremont? still working on logic of what a parkway, blvd, way, court, place, etc. is. sure you can suss out some order in naming patterns, but it's so seemingly random and chaotic.
* there is a psychological comfort in knowing where you're going, without having to rely on GPS for everything. can focus more fully, scan, anticipate. constantly glancing at a screen while driving really sucks. it's super distracting. kind of anxiety producing and nerve racking. now you must look ahead, behind, at screen, etc. eyes bouncing around.
* GPS has an egocentric orientation that probably isn't all that helpful. some other cultures don't have this egocentric bent in their culture. this is one reason why the directions never really stick -- it's always just left right or straight. but if you turn on allocentric view in maps, it does become confusing. e.g., turn left when you see car bend around right b/c in your head you know you're traveling south not north.

## My thoughts

* place is important for memory. where did you grow up? where are you from? these are among our first questions for a reason. place matters to our identity. group my life's events by where we lived at the time. when i think about my childhood, place is practically everything.
* Geography of Nowhere. suburbia is devoid of place. car dependent landscapes mean we mostly stay in our houses, watching TV. no sense of community or place anymore. this makes navigation harder. we don't have much of a connection to the land. it's just chain stores and cookie cutter suburban neighborhoods. why should we learn to love our home? Geography of Nowhere -- people move every 5 yrs. no real attachment or rooting in place.
* feel sorry for kids growing up. confined to house like an indoor cat.
* by relying less on GPS to guide me, i might strengthen my connection to place.
* with the atrophy of our hippocampus, are we losing more than our wayfinding skills? are we losing some memory power, setting ourselves up for cognitive decline? am i atrophying my memory, reducing a sense of place and hence a sense of identity?
