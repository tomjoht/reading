Why did I start reading this book?

* in my experiment to get rid of smartphone, this was supposed to be an app you can't live without. read some initial studies about london cabbies and hippocampus effects

* noticed some interesting initial effects in navigating without gps. more of a confidence. piqued my interest.

* always had a bad sense of direction without understanding why. was there some secret to navigation?

* a nagging sense that the egocentric model of wayfinding with google maps was problematic in that although i seemed to frequently use these apps, they didn't help my sense of direction at all. some kind of paradox.

* Lived in Renton a year but still was routing everywhere. ridiculous. places i'd been to many, many times.


## Authors main argument

wayfinding isn't just a matter of imposing a mental map in your head on the surroundings. it's more complicated, like following a song, or connecting visual points.

wayfinders are deeply connected with their land. direct experience on the land leads to more careful observations and attentiveness. 

wayfinding is closely tied to memory in your hippocampus. think of greek's memory palace technique. beginning of story is to start with a place.

wayfinding is first scientific mode of thinking, as you put together clues to extrapolate larger judgments.

she looks at several cultures: oceania/pacific, arctic, aboriginee. in each of these cultures, wayfinding is becoming a lost art. no real place for a navigator in today's economy.

she also looks at animals. bees is mindblowing.

i didn't realize that wayfinding and navigation is a topic of immense interest and a knowledge domain unto itself with a ton of books written about it.

## My conclusions

probably never develop great wayfinding skills. but i'm no longer beating myself up about this, or thinking that i'm somehow deficient and it's my fault. reasons for lack of wayfinding skills:

* not closely connected with land. travel through mediated experience of car, reducing noise, etc. one reason i liked riding a motorcycle so much was the immersion in an environment, directly experiencing the outdoors. is why i like biking too.
  
* travel too quickly through land. a car moves you much too fast to really notice anything. e.g., traveling 75mph down freeway.

* street navigation doesn't have the same logic as something you might intuit from nature, from wind or wave patterns, or starlight. how do you predict that a certain street route will take you across I-5 from Capitol Hill over to Fremont? still working on logic of what a parkway, blvd, way, court, place, etc. is. sure you can suss out some order in naming patterns, but it's so seemingly random and chaotic.

## Some positives

* there is a psychological comfort in knowing where you're going, without having to rely on GPS for everything. can focus more fully, scan, anticipate. constantly glancing at a screen while driving really sucks. it's super distracting. kind of anxiety producing and nerve racking. now you must look ahead, behind, at screen, etc. eyes bouncing around.
  
* GPS has an egocentric orientation that probably isn't all that helpful. some other cultures don't have this egocentric bent in their culture. this is one reason why the directions never really stick -- it's always just left right or straight. but if you turn on allocentric view in maps, it does become confusing. e.g., turn left when you see car bend around right b/c in your head you know you're traveling south not north. but at the same time, perhaps more helpful in understanding the land.

## My thoughts

* place is important for memory. where did you grow up? where are you from? these are among our first questions for a reason. place matters to our identity. group my life's events by where we lived at the time. when i think about my childhood, place is practically everything.
* 
* Geography of Nowhere. suburbia is devoid of place. car dependent landscapes mean we mostly stay in our houses, watching TV. no sense of community or place anymore. this makes navigation harder. we don't have much of a connection to the land. it's just chain stores and cookie cutter suburban neighborhoods. why should we learn to love our home? Geography of Nowhere -- people move every 5 yrs. no real attachment or rooting in place.

* feel sorry for kids growing up. confined to house like an indoor cat. feel really sorry for this poor cat.
  
* by relying less on GPS to guide me, i might strengthen my connection to place.
  
* with the atrophy of our hippocampus, are we losing more than our wayfinding skills? are we losing some memory power, setting ourselves up for cognitive decline? am i atrophying my memory, reducing a sense of place and hence a sense of identity? the key concept is that hippocampus isn't just wayfinding alone but is intertwined with memory skills.

* GPS is one more example of offloading cognitive tasks to the computer. no real sense of where we are in the world, just turn left, right, straight. kind of reducing our orientation in the world. friend routes her way to station every day. it's like a 20 min. city walk.
  
* sometimes the routes make no sense. shave off one minute by taking a totally different route, might be much more difficult (e.g., freeway merging, exiting very quickly, twisting, etc). the idea that we'd be alerted about congestion and reroute is only a slim use case and often you don't know why the route is suggesting what it suggests until you get caught in some congestion due to a crash.
   
* psychologically to be at the mercy of the algorithm, to trust that GPS routing knows best and you don't know why it wants you to go a certain way, it just does, is to relinquish your own acumen to that of a computer. does this blend to other aspects of life? we don't know why we do certain things, the algorithm just tells us. and when we disobey, we sometimes suffer consequences (get stuck in congestion). but other times, we find that the route saved 1 minute and took us on some helter-skelter path we'll never remember.

* GPS keeps us confused by constantly switching routes. if you have lots of options and different times of day are slightly more efficient, you sort of never end up learning how to get to places.

* want to increase sense of place, identity, peace of mind by increasing navigational certitude. but just memorizing a map and imposing it on the world isn't how people really wayfind. our brain doesn't store a mental map of euclidian geometry onto the world, comparing what we see with that map. wayfinding is more like feeling the land and observing the details to extrapolate conclusions, constant feedback loops of processing input and making observations, and adjusting, etc.
