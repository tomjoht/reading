Why did I start reading this book?

* in my experiment to get rid of smartphone, this was supposed to be an app you can't live without. read some initial studies about london cabbies and hippocampus effects

* noticed some interesting initial effects in navigating without gps. more of a confidence. piqued my interest.

* always had a bad sense of direction without understanding why. was there some secret to navigation?

* a nagging sense that the egocentric model of wayfinding with google maps was problematic in that although i seemed to frequently use these apps, they didn't help my sense of direction at all. some kind of paradox.

* Lived in Renton a year but still was routing everywhere. ridiculous. places i'd been to many, many times.


## Authors main argument

wayfinding isn't just a matter of imposing a mental map in your head on the surroundings. it's more complicated, like following a song, or connecting visual points.

wayfinders are deeply connected with their land. direct experience on the land leads to more careful observations and attentiveness. 

wayfinding is closely tied to memory in your hippocampus. some way wayfinding is first scientific mode of thinking, as you put together clues to extrapolate larger judgments.


## My conclusions

probably never develop great wayfinding skills. reasons:

* not closely connected with land. travel through mediated experience.
* travel too quickly through land. a car moves you much more quickly.
* street navigation doesn't have the same logic as something you might intuit from nature, from wind or wave patterns, or starlight. how do you predict that a certain street route will take you across I-5 from Capitol Hill over to Fremont? 
* there is a psychological comfort in knowing where you're going, without having to rely on GPS for everything. 
* GPS has an egocentric orientation that probably isn't all that helpful. some other cultures don't have this egocentric bent in their culture.

## My thoughts

* place is important for memory. where did you grow up? where are you from? these are among our first questions for a reason. place matters to our identity.
* Geography of Nowhere. suburbia is devoid of place. car dependent landscapes mean we mostly stay in our houses, watching TV. no sense of community or place anymore. this makes navigation harder.
* by relying less on GPS to guide me, i might strengthen my connection to place.
